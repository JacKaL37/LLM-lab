INPUT: A speech-to-text rant. 

```
Okay, my starting, like, idea is, what am I hoping to gain from this course? Or rather, impart? Or, what's the value of this course? I mean, cognition has always been, man. Cognition is this thing that we sort of struggle to divine at times, but ultimately, I see it as the thing that guides behavior. Now, it's not the same thing as just a physics process, but it's certainly a thing that guides behavior. Now, do I think of gravity as cognition? Not as such. Not, like, truly. But they're on the same continuum of complexity. Things that drive change. Things that drive behavioral activity in the world. And, you know, we look at each other, and we know, mostly, that we're all other thinking things, you know? But there's so much else that is now emitting behavior, right? And the more complex our things become, the more black-boxy they get. Black-boxy. This idea that, as something becomes more and more, it starts to become more and more muddy, foggy, difficult to see the whole thing. You know, we talk about how our algorithms behave in the world, right? We talk about how our phones do things. We get annoyed at them for not doing a thing correctly. And we don't, I mean, none of us really know exactly how a phone works. I've got enough skill now that I could really, I could probably dig down pretty deep, but I am NOT a phone engineer. I am not a person who sees that whole system for what it is. Because, to me, it's a black box. It's really key. Okay, so black boxing is a pretty big deal in this whole discussion. Because I think, for me, one of the things that really unites human cognitive processes and modern technology is that they are this complex. They are complex enough to be black boxes. So, this course is going to have a whole lot of unification, I guess. It's sort of the touchstone between something that we have captured in a model of human cognition that then goes on to be used in one of two ways, perhaps both. One being to attempt, again, to model cognition, right? To produce a prediction that is useful. In science, that's kind of the idea of science. You are producing predictions that allow you to, you know, work in the world a little better. If we have a prediction, a model, that penicillin will reduce the infection in your body, then that's pretty useful. And not just for an application, but also for better understanding the cognitive system itself. So, if we have predictions, but then we encounter scenarios where those predictions don't hold, or we encounter scenarios we didn't expect those predictions to hold in, and they do, well dang, that's new information. That's new knowledge. That's science, baby. The scientific method. So, that's one way that modeling is a big deal, right, in science. It's pretty fundamental, and unfortunately we don't use that word often enough. Model. Because it's pretty general, but all it really means is it's a reduced form of something, some real phenomenon. And to quote Box, models are complex. No, Box's quote is, all models are wrong, some are useful. And that is really what you can hang your hat on in this course. That's perhaps one of the big, big bullets of this course. So, okay, back to, like, the ways these models are useful. The other way is, when you're not actually trying to say anything about human cognition, right, you're not really even interfacing with humans, but you've got this neat little model now. You have this tool that models something about humans, but you can just kind of do whatever you want with it. That's the fundamental progression of modern artificial intelligence, is we start off with these things that mimic elements of human information processing in the brain, and then they take on a new life, unconstrained by, you know, human limitations. They can have as many virtual neurons as they want, they can arrange their populations around whatever data they need to, they can learn in ways that are similar but not identical to human learning processes, and dang, then you end up with these pretty crazy intelligences that we have some common, you know, memetic shared structure with. They're not a hundred percent the same as us, but dang, they can do some of the things that we can do, like pattern match. These days a robot can look at a tree and tell you just as much about it as an arborist. That's pretty wild. So yeah, I'm gonna stop the rant there for a minute.
