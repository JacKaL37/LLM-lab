1
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:11,117
Hello. My name is Ann Druyan.

2
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:13,424
When Carl Sagan, Steven Soter and I...

3
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:16,613
...wrote the Cosmos TV series
in the late 1970s...

4
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:18,313
...a lot of things where different.

5
00:00:18,313 --> 00:00:20,813
Back then, the U.S. and the Soviet Union...

6
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:24,313
...held the hole planet
in their perpetual hostage crisis...

7
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:25,719
...called the Cold War.

8
00:00:25,813 --> 00:00:29,513
The wealth and scientific ingenuity
of our civilization...

9
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:32,113
...was being squandered
on a runaway arms raise.

10
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:35,213
Then employed more than half the world scientists...

11
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:39,513
...and infested the world
with 50.000 nuclear weapons.

12
00:00:40,513 --> 00:00:42,813
So much has happened since then.

13
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:44,413
The Cold War is history...

14
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:47,413
...and science has made great strides.

15
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:51,213
We've completed the spacecraft
recognizance of the Solar System...

16
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:55,213
...the preliminary mapping of the visible
universe that surrounds us...

17
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:59,213
...and we've charted the universe within:
the human genome.

18
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:04,013
When Cosmos was first broadcast
there was no World Wide Web...

19
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:06,213
...it was a different world.

20
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:08,313
What a tribute to Carl Sagan...

21
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:12,013
...a scientist who took many a punch
for daring to speculate...

22
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:16,813
...that even after 20 of the most eventful
years in the history of science...

23
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:21,813
...Cosmos requires few revisions
and indeed is rich in prophecy.

24
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:27,613
Cosmos is both the history
of the scientific enterprise...

25
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:31,513
...and an attempt to convey the spiritual high...

26
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:33,813
...of its central revelation:

27
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:36,713
Our oneness with the universe.

28
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:40,713
Now, please, enjoy Cosmos,
the proud saga of how...

29
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:45,113
...through the searching of 40.000
generations of our ancestors...

30
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:48,113
...we have come to discover
our coordinates...

31
00:01:48,113 --> 00:01:50,713
...in space and in time.

32
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:55,313
And how, through the awesomely
powerful method of science...

33
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:59,513
...we have been able to reconstruct
the sweep of cosmic evolution...

34
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:04,413
...and defined our own part
in its great story.

35
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,024
SAGAN:
The cosmos is all that is...

36
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:22,555
...or ever was or ever will be.

37
00:03:22,907 --> 00:03:25,889
Our contemplations of
the cosmos stir us.

38
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:31,635
There is a tingling in the spine,
a catch in the voice...

39
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:35,300
...a faint sensation,
as if a distant memory...

40
00:03:35,513 --> 00:03:37,879
...of falling from a great height.

41
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:42,212
We know we are approaching
the grandest of mysteries.

42
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:49,825
The size and age of the cosmos...

43
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:52,495
...are beyond ordinary
human understanding.

44
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:57,292
Lost somewhere between
immensity and eternity...

45
00:03:57,501 --> 00:04:00,436
...is our tiny planetary home,
the Earth.

46
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:03,869
For the first time,
we have the power to decide...

47
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:06,668
...the fate of our planet
and ourselves.

48
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:08,708
This is a time of great danger.

49
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:13,145
But our species is
young and curious and brave.

50
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,045
It shows much promise.

51
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:17,379
In the last few millennia,
we've made...

52
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:20,455
...the most astonishing
and unexpected discoveries...

53
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:23,889
...about the cosmos
and our place within it.

54
00:04:24,094 --> 00:04:26,892
I believe our future depends
powerfully on...

55
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:29,429
...how well we understand
this cosmos...

56
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:32,761
...in which we float
like a mote of dust...

57
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,801
...in the morning sky.

58
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:37,906
(SEA GULL CHIRPS)

59
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:44,038
We're about to begin a journey
through the cosmos.

60
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:47,907
We'll encounter galaxies and suns
and planets...

61
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:50,052
...life and consciousness...

62
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:54,020
...coming into being,
evolving and perishing.

63
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:57,949
Worlds of ice and stars of diamond.

64
00:04:58,162 --> 00:05:00,153
Atoms as massive as suns...

65
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:03,356
...and universes smaller than atoms.

66
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:06,100
But it's also a story
of our own planet...

67
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:08,897
...and the plants and animals
that share it with us.

68
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:12,166
And it's a story about us:

69
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:15,777
How we achieved our present
understanding of the cosmos...

70
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,279
...how the cosmos has shaped
our evolution and our culture...

71
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,075
...and what our fate may be.

72
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:29,656
We wish to pursue the truth,
no matter where it leads.

73
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,229
But to find the truth, we need
imagination and skepticism both.

74
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:36,695
We will not be afraid to speculate.

75
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:41,338
But we will be careful to distinguish
speculation from fact.

76
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:46,168
The cosmos is full beyond measure
of elegant truths...

77
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:48,675
...of exquisite interrelationships...

78
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,871
...of the awesome machinery of nature.

79
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,712
The surface of the Earth is
the shore of the cosmic ocean.

80
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:01,289
On this shore, we have learned
most of what we know.

81
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:04,052
Recently, we've waded
a little way out...

82
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:08,527
...maybe ankle-deep,
and the water seems inviting.

83
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:13,528
Some part of our being knows
this is where we came from.

84
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:16,171
We long to return.

85
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,632
And we can.

86
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:21,971
Because the cosmos is also within us.
We're made of star-stuff.

87
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:26,582
We are a way for the cosmos
to know itself.

88
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,511
The journey for each of us
begins here.

89
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,617
We're going to explore the cosmos
in a ship of the imagination...

90
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:38,056
...unfettered by ordinary limits
on speed and size...

91
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:40,992
...drawn by the music
of cosmic harmonies...

92
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:43,598
...it can take us anywhere
in space and time.

93
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:46,594
Perfect as a snowflake...

94
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:50,565
...organic as a dandelion seed...

95
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:51,934
...it will carry us...

96
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:56,010
...to worlds of dreams
and worlds of facts.

97
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:58,005
Come with me.

98
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:14,029
Before us is the cosmos
on the grandest scale we know.

99
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:21,870
We are far from the shores of Earth...

100
00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:25,200
...in the uncharted reaches
of the cosmic ocean.

101
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:28,901
Strewn like sea froth
on the waves of space...

102
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:31,843
...are innumerable
faint tendrils of light.

103
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:34,415
Some of them containing hundreds...

104
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:37,815
...of billions of suns.

105
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:40,684
These are the galaxies...

106
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:44,918
...drifting endlessly
in the great cosmic dark.

107
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:49,622
In our ship of the imagination...

108
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:53,894
...we are halfway to the edge
of the known universe.

109
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:06,705
In this, the first of
our cosmic voyages...

110
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,546
...we begin to explore the universe
revealed by science.

111
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:23,365
Our course will eventually carry us
to a far-off and exotic world.

112
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:26,559
But from the depths of space,
we cannot detect even...

113
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,001
...the cluster of galaxies
in which our Milky Way is embedded...

114
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,040
...much less the sun or the Earth.

115
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:51,860
We are in the realm
of the galaxies...

116
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:55,498
...8 billion light years from home.

117
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:04,900
No matter where we travel,
the patterns of nature are the same...

118
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:08,601
...as in the form
of this spiral galaxy.

119
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:13,547
The same laws of physics
apply everywhere...

120
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,877
...throughout the cosmos.

121
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,219
But we have just begun to
understand these laws.

122
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:28,524
The universe is rich in mystery.

123
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,730
Near the center of
a cluster of galaxies...

124
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:39,739
...there's sometimes a rogue,
elliptical galaxy...

125
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:42,002
...made of a trillion suns...

126
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:44,407
...which devours its neighbors.

127
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:46,845
Perhaps this cyclone of stars...

128
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,178
...is what astronomers on Earth
call a quasar.

129
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:09,537
Our ordinary measures
of distance fail us...

130
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,504
...here in the realm of the galaxies.

131
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,303
We need a much larger unit:
the light year.

132
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:18,072
It measures how far
light travels in a year...

133
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:21,183
...nearly 10 trillion kilometers.

134
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:25,947
It measures not time,
but enormous distances.

135
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:41,432
In the Hercules cluster...

136
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:46,098
...the individual galaxies are
about 300,000 light years apart.

137
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,041
So light takes about 300,000 years...

138
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:53,444
...to go from one galaxy to another.

139
00:10:56,753 --> 00:11:00,314
Like stars and planets and people...

140
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:04,688
...galaxies are born, live and die.

141
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:09,188
They may all experience
a tumultuous adolescence.

142
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,529
During their first 100 million years,
their cores may explode.

143
00:11:13,737 --> 00:11:16,672
Seen in radio light,
great jets of energy...

144
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:20,001
...pour out and echo
across the cosmos.

145
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:25,548
Worlds near the core or along
the jets would be incinerated.

146
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,309
I wonder how many planets
and how many civilizations...

147
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,385
...might be destroyed.

148
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:44,298
In the Pegasus cluster,
there's a ring galaxy...

149
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:47,664
...the wreckage left from
the collision of two galaxies.

150
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:51,432
A splash in the cosmic pond.

151
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:55,344
Individual galaxies may
explode and collide...

152
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:59,037
...and their constituent stars
may blow up as well.

153
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:02,249
In this supernova explosion...

154
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:06,582
...a single star outshines
the rest of its galaxy.

155
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:12,784
We are approaching what
astronomers on Earth call...

156
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:15,226
...the Local Group.

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,937
Three million light years across,
it contains some 20 galaxies.

158
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:26,602
It's a sparse and rather typical
chain of islands...

159
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,608
...in the immense cosmic ocean.

160
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:34,777
We are now only 2 million
light years from home.

161
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:39,288
On the maps of space,
this galaxy is called M31...

162
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:41,684
...the great galaxy Andromeda.

163
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:45,487
It's a vast storm of stars
and gas and dust.

164
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:46,993
As we pass over it...

165
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:50,860
...we see one of its small
satellite galaxies.

166
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:56,332
Clusters of galaxies...

167
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,100
...and the stars of
individual galaxies...

168
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:02,039
...are all held together by gravity.

169
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:03,974
Surrounding M31...

170
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:07,912
...are hundreds of globular
star clusters.

171
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,114
We're approaching one of them.

172
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:15,116
Each cluster orbits the massive
center of the galaxy.

173
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:19,523
Some contain up to
a million separate stars.

174
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:23,524
Every globular cluster is
like a swarm of bees...

175
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:25,133
...bound by gravity...

176
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:27,565
...every bee, a sun.

177
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:33,198
From Pegasus,
our voyage has taken us...

178
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,937
...200 million light years
to the Local Group...

179
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:41,413
...dominated by two
great spiral galaxies.

180
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:46,420
Beyond M31 is another
very similar galaxy.

181
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,057
Its spiral arms slowly turning...

182
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,023
...once every quarter billion years.

183
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:01,133
This is our own Milky Way...

184
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:04,205
...seen from the outside.

185
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,110
This is the home galaxy
of the human species.

186
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:27,563
In the obscure backwaters
of the Carina-Cygnus spiral arm...

187
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:31,096
...we humans have evolved
to consciousness...

188
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:34,498
...and some measure of understanding.

189
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,409
Concentrated in its brilliant core...

190
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:48,345
...and strewn along its spiral arms...

191
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:52,579
...are 400 billion suns.

192
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,449
It takes light 100,000 years
to travel...

193
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:00,630
...from one end of the galaxy
to the other.

194
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:06,625
Within this galaxy are
stars and worlds...

195
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:11,171
...and, it may be, an enormous
diversity of living things...

196
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:16,311
...and intelligent beings
and space faring civilizations.

197
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:27,019
Scattered among the stars
of the Milky Way...

198
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:29,192
...are supernova remnants...

199
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:33,658
...each one the remains of
a colossal stellar explosion.

200
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,955
These filaments of glowing gas...

201
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:40,193
...are the outer layers of a star
which has recently destroyed itself.

202
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:42,132
The gas is unraveling...

203
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:45,866
...returning star-stuff
back into space.

204
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:49,044
(PULSAR HISSES)

205
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,345
And at its heart, are the remains
of the original star...

206
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:58,214
...a dense, shrunken stellar
fragment called a pulsar.

207
00:15:58,421 --> 00:16:01,720
A natural lighthouse,
blinking and hissing.

208
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,450
A sun that spins twice each second.

209
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:14,668
Pulsars keep such perfect time
that the first one discovered...

210
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:17,772
...was thought to be a sign of
extraterrestrial intelligence.

211
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:20,340
Perhaps a navigational beacon...

212
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:23,479
...for great ships that travel
across the light years...

213
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:25,838
...and between the stars.

214
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:33,081
There may be such intelligences
and such starships...

215
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,056
...but pulsars are not
their signature.

216
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:50,638
Instead, they are
the doleful reminders...

217
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,603
...that nothing lasts forever...

218
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:55,505
...that stars also die.

219
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:02,084
We continue to plummet,
falling thousands of light years...

220
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:04,810
...towards the plane of the galaxy.

221
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:08,784
This is the Milky Way...

222
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:11,460
...our galaxy seen edge on.

223
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:13,754
Billions of nuclear furnaces...

224
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:17,024
...converting matter into starlight.

225
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:24,839
Some stars are flimsy
as a soap bubble.

226
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:29,410
Others are 100 trillion times
denser than lead.

227
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:33,140
The hottest stars are
destined to die young.

228
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,848
But red giants are mostly elderly.

229
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:41,149
Such stars are unlikely
to have inhabited planets.

230
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:46,723
But yellow dwarf stars,
like the sun...

231
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,798
...are middle-aged
and they are far more common.

232
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:54,436
These stars may have
planetary systems.

233
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:58,233
And on such planets, for the first
time on our cosmic voyage...

234
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:00,932
...we encounter rare forms of matter:

235
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:05,740
Ice and rock, air and liquid water.

236
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:12,314
Close to this yellow star...

237
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:15,547
...is a small, warm, cloudy world...

238
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,920
...with continents and oceans.

239
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:23,065
These conditions permit an even more
precious form of matter to arise:

240
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:24,763
Life.

241
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:33,840
But this is not the Earth.

242
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:38,708
Intelligent beings have evolved
and reworked this planetary surface...

243
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:41,782
...in a massive engineering
enterprise.

244
00:18:41,985 --> 00:18:45,216
In the Milky Way galaxy,
there may be many worlds...

245
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:48,858
...on which matter has
grown to consciousness.

246
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:59,465
I wonder, are they very
different from us?

247
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,102
What do they look like?

248
00:19:01,304 --> 00:19:05,400
What are their politics, technology,
music, religion?

249
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:10,403
Or do they have patterns of culture
we can't begin to imagine?

250
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:14,845
Are they also a danger to themselves?

251
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:25,285
Among the many glowing clouds
of interstellar gas...

252
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:28,487
...is one called the Orion Nebula...

253
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:31,860
...only 1 500 light years from Earth.

254
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:40,674
These three bright stars
are seen by earthlings...

255
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:45,678
...as the belt in the familiar
constellation of Orion the hunter.

256
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:55,251
The nebula appears from Earth
as a patch of light...

257
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:59,690
...the middle star in Orion's sword.

258
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,138
But it is not a star.

259
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,275
It is another thing entirely.

260
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:18,243
A cloud that veils
one of nature's secret places.

261
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:32,227
This is a stellar nursery,
a place where stars are born.

262
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:35,226
They condense by gravity
from gas and dust...

263
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:40,266
...until their temperatures become
so high that they begin to shine.

264
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:43,534
Such clouds mark
the births of stars...

265
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,573
...as others bear witness
to their deaths.

266
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:56,914
After stars condense in the hidden
interiors of interstellar clouds...

267
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,610
...what happens to them?

268
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:02,349
The Pleiades are a loose cluster
of young stars...

269
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,618
...only 50 million years old.

270
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:09,765
These fledgling stars are just
being let out into the galaxy.

271
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:13,196
Still surrounded by wisps
of nebulosity...

272
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:16,930
...the gas and dust
from which they formed.

273
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:54,708
There are clouds
that hang like inkblots...

274
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:56,538
...between the stars.

275
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:59,544
They are made of fine, rocky dust...

276
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:02,149
...organic matter and ice.

277
00:22:03,853 --> 00:22:07,846
Inside, a few stars begin to turn on.

278
00:22:08,057 --> 00:22:09,957
Nearby worlds of ice evaporate...

279
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,753
...and form long, comet-like tails...

280
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:15,897
...driven back by the stellar winds.

281
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:24,102
Black clouds, light years across...

282
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:26,275
...drift between the stars.

283
00:22:26,476 --> 00:22:29,411
They're filled with
organic molecules.

284
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:32,479
The building blocks of life
are everywhere.

285
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:34,650
They are easily made.

286
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:39,788
On how many worlds have such complex
molecules assembled themselves...

287
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:43,719
...into patterns we would
call alive?

288
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:53,934
Most stars belong to systems
of two or three or many suns...

289
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:56,128
...bound together by gravity.

290
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:59,570
Each system is isolated
from its neighbors...

291
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:01,334
...by the light years.

292
00:23:03,646 --> 00:23:07,446
We are approaching a single,
ordinary, yellow dwarf star...

293
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,346
...surrounded by a system
of nine planets...

294
00:23:10,553 --> 00:23:15,013
...dozens of moons, thousands of
asteroids and billions of comets:

295
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:17,283
The family of the sun.

296
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:23,294
Only four light hours from Earth
is the planet Neptune...

297
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:26,263
...and its giant satellite, Triton.

298
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:32,873
Even in the outskirts
of our own solar system...

299
00:23:33,076 --> 00:23:37,172
...we humans have barely begun
our explorations.

300
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:41,014
Only a century ago...

301
00:23:41,217 --> 00:23:45,085
...we were ignorant even of
the existence of the planet Pluto.

302
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:50,225
Its moon, Charon, remained
undiscovered until 1978.

303
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:52,287
Since the discovery of Kuiper Belt objects
in 1 992, Pluto has come to be seen...

304
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:55,362
...as the largest member of
this population of comets.

305
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:59,658
The rings of Uranus were
first detected in 1977.

306
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:58,591
Many astronomers no longer
regard it as a planet.

307
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:03,737
There are new worlds to chart
even this close to home.

308
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:10,509
Saturn is a giant gas world.

309
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:12,681
If it has a solid surface...

310
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:16,682
...it must lie far below
the clouds we see.

311
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:20,255
Saturn's majestic rings...

312
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:23,721
...are made of trillions
of orbiting snowballs.

313
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,626
We are now only 80 light minutes
from home.

314
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:37,328
A mere 1 1/2 billion kilometers.

315
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:55,022
The largest planet in our
solar system is Jupiter.

316
00:24:55,224 --> 00:24:59,558
On its dark side, super bolts
of lightning illuminate the clouds...

317
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:04,597
...as first revealed by
the Voyager spacecraft in 1979.

318
00:25:16,813 --> 00:25:18,644
Inside the orbit of Jupiter...

319
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,443
...are countless shattered
and broken world-lets:

320
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:24,244
The asteroids.

321
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:26,547
These reefs and shoals...

322
00:25:26,756 --> 00:25:29,919
...mark the border of
the realm of giant planets.

323
00:25:30,126 --> 00:25:34,529
We are now entering the shallows
of the solar system.

324
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:40,599
Here there are worlds with thin
atmospheres and solid surfaces:

325
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:42,134
Earth-like planets...

326
00:25:42,338 --> 00:25:46,365
...with landscapes crying out
for careful exploration.

327
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:49,568
This world is Mars.

328
00:25:52,048 --> 00:25:55,540
In 1976, after a year's voyage...

329
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:58,242
...two robot explorers from Earth...

330
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:01,048
...landed on this alien shore.

331
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:06,520
On Mars, there is a volcano
as wide as Arizona...

332
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:09,493
...and almost three times
the height of Mount Everest.

333
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:12,827
We've named it Mount Olympus.

334
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,475
This is a world of wonders.

335
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:24,773
Mars is a planet with ancient
river valleys...

336
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:29,918
...and violent sandstorms driven
by winds at half the speed of sound.

337
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:41,961
There is a giant rift in its surface
5000 kilometers long.

338
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:45,623
It's called Vallis Marinaris.

339
00:26:45,835 --> 00:26:48,167
The valley of
the Mariner spacecraft...

340
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:52,740
...that came to explore Mars
from a nearby world.

341
00:27:10,793 --> 00:27:14,058
In this, our first cosmic voyage...

342
00:27:14,263 --> 00:27:17,096
...we have just begun
the reconnaissance of Mars...

343
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,758
...and all those other planets
and stars and galaxies.

344
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,236
In voyages to come,
we will explore them more fully.

345
00:27:32,782 --> 00:27:36,445
But now, we travel the few
remaining light minutes...

346
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:41,385
...to a blue and cloudy world,
third from the sun.

347
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,850
The end of our long journey...

348
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,460
...is the world where we began.

349
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:48,627
Our travels allow us...

350
00:27:48,831 --> 00:27:51,095
...to see the Earth anew...

351
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,360
...as if we came from somewhere else.

352
00:27:56,806 --> 00:27:59,434
There are a hundred billion
galaxies...

353
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:02,634
...and a billion trillion stars.

354
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:07,441
Why should this modest planet
be the only inhabited world?

355
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:12,246
To me, it seems far more likely
that the cosmos is brimming over...

356
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:14,582
...with life and intelligence.

357
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,452
But so far, every living thing...

358
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,252
...every conscious being...

359
00:28:19,462 --> 00:28:22,158
...every civilization
we know anything about...

360
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:25,061
...lived there, on Earth.

361
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:33,935
Beneath these clouds...

362
00:28:34,143 --> 00:28:37,772
...the drama of the human species
has been unfolded.

363
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:43,647
We have, at last, come home.

364
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:55,557
Welcome to the planet Earth.

365
00:28:55,898 --> 00:28:58,731
A place with blue nitrogen skies...

366
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:00,834
...oceans of liquid water...

367
00:29:01,037 --> 00:29:02,368
...cool forests...

368
00:29:02,571 --> 00:29:03,970
...soft meadows.

369
00:29:04,173 --> 00:29:07,802
A world positively rippling with life.

370
00:29:08,344 --> 00:29:11,871
In the cosmic perspective,
it is, for the moment, unique.

371
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:14,709
The only world in which
we know with certainty...

372
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:18,910
...that the matter of the cosmos
has become alive and aware.

373
00:29:19,155 --> 00:29:21,988
There must be many such worlds
scattered through space...

374
00:29:22,191 --> 00:29:24,625
...but our search for them
begins here...

375
00:29:24,827 --> 00:29:28,228
...with the accumulated wisdom of
the men and women of our species...

376
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:30,228
...acquired at great cost...

377
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:32,560
...over a million years.

378
00:30:15,711 --> 00:30:18,612
There was once a time when
our planet seemed immense.

379
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:21,305
When it was the only world
we could explore.

380
00:30:21,517 --> 00:30:25,749
Its true size was first worked out
in a simple and ingenious way...

381
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:30,221
...by a man who lived here in Egypt,
in the third century B.C.

382
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:40,431
This tower may have been
a communications tower.

383
00:30:40,636 --> 00:30:44,402
Part of a network running along
the North African coast...

384
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:49,010
...by which signal bonfires were used
to communicate messages of state.

385
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:53,614
It also may have been used
as a lighthouse...

386
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:57,081
...a navigational beacon
for sailing ships...

387
00:30:57,286 --> 00:30:59,618
...out there in the Mediterranean Sea.

388
00:30:59,822 --> 00:31:02,347
It is about 50 kilometers west...

389
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,222
...of what was once one of the great
cities of the world, Alexandria.

390
00:31:08,164 --> 00:31:10,189
In Alexandria, at that time...

391
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,425
...there lived a man named
Eratosthenes.

392
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:18,130
A competitor called him "beta," the
second letter of the Greek alphabet...

393
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:23,039
...because, he said, "Eratosthenes
was second best in everything."

394
00:31:23,245 --> 00:31:27,978
But it seems clear, in many fields,
Eratosthenes was "alpha."

395
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:31,847
He was an astronomer, historian,
geographer...

396
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:35,955
...philosopher, poet, theater critic
and mathematician.

397
00:31:36,158 --> 00:31:40,561
He was also the chief librarian
of the Great Library of Alexandria.

398
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:45,700
And one day while reading
a papyrus book in the library...

399
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:49,837
...he came upon a curious account.

400
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,910
Far to the south, he read...

401
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:01,446
...at the frontier outpost of Syene...

402
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:05,142
...something notable could be seen
on the longest day of the year.

403
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,649
On June 21st...

404
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:14,921
...the shadows of a temple column,
or a vertical stick...

405
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,724
...would grow shorter
as noon approached.

406
00:32:23,672 --> 00:32:25,299
As the hours crept towards midday...

407
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:29,740
...the sun's rays would slither down
the sides of a deep well...

408
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:32,436
...which on other days
would remain in shadow.

409
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:42,016
And then, precisely at noon...

410
00:32:42,224 --> 00:32:44,624
...columns would cast no shadows.

411
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:49,355
And the sun would shine directly down
into the water of the well.

412
00:32:55,504 --> 00:32:56,937
At that moment...

413
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:59,664
...the sun was exactly overhead.

414
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,214
It was an observation that someone else
might easily have ignored.

415
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:13,286
Sticks, shadows,
reflections in wells...

416
00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:15,218
...the position of the sun...

417
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:17,449
...simple, everyday matters.

418
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,720
Of what possible importance
might they be?

419
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:23,792
But Eratosthenes was a scientist...

420
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:27,457
...and his contemplation of these
homely matters changed the world...

421
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,934
...in a way, made the world.

422
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:34,269
Because Eratosthenes had
the presence of mind to experiment...

423
00:33:34,476 --> 00:33:38,936
...to actually ask whether
back here, near Alexandria...

424
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:44,085
...a stick cast a shadow
near noon on June the 21 st.

425
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:47,251
And it turns out, sticks do.

426
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:51,959
An overly skeptical person
might have said...

427
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:54,823
...that the report from Syene
was an error.

428
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,828
But it's an absolutely
straightforward observation.

429
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:01,196
Why would anyone lie
on such a trivial matter?

430
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:04,133
Eratosthenes asked himself
how it could be...

431
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,365
...that at the same moment...

432
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:09,237
...a stick in Syene
would cast no shadow...

433
00:34:09,445 --> 00:34:13,006
...and a stick in Alexandria,
800 kilometers to the north...

434
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:15,775
...would cast a very definite shadow.

435
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:22,119
Here is a map of ancient Egypt.

436
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:26,325
I've inserted two sticks, or obelisks.

437
00:34:26,528 --> 00:34:30,988
One up here in Alexandria
and one down here in Syene.

438
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,034
Now, if at a certain moment
each stick casts...

439
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:37,637
...no shadow, no shadow at all...

440
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:42,273
...that's perfectly easy to understand,
provided the Earth is flat.

441
00:34:42,478 --> 00:34:45,675
If the shadow at Syene is
at a certain length...

442
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:48,315
...and the shadow at Alexandria is
the same length...

443
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:51,077
...that also makes sense
on a flat Earth.

444
00:34:51,553 --> 00:34:54,784
But how could it be,
Eratosthenes asked...

445
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:59,484
...that at the same instant
there was no shadow at Syene...

446
00:34:59,828 --> 00:35:04,492
...and a very substantial shadow
at Alexandria?

447
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:10,396
The only answer was that
the surface of the Earth is curved.

448
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,970
Not only that...

449
00:35:12,174 --> 00:35:15,974
...but the greater the curvature,
the bigger the difference...

450
00:35:16,178 --> 00:35:19,875
...in the lengths of the shadows.
The sun is so far away...

451
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,516
...that its rays are parallel
when they reach the Earth.

452
00:35:22,718 --> 00:35:26,984
Sticks at different angles to the sun
will cast shadows at different lengths.

453
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:30,625
For the observed difference
in the shadow lengths...

454
00:35:30,826 --> 00:35:33,260
...the distance between
Alexandria and Syene...

455
00:35:33,462 --> 00:35:37,364
...had to be about seven degrees
along the surface of the Earth.

456
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:41,468
By that, I mean, if you would imagine
these sticks extending...

457
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,104
...all the way down
to the center of the Earth...

458
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:47,467
...they would there intersect
at an angle of seven degrees.

459
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:50,839
Well, seven degrees is
something like a 50th...

460
00:35:51,046 --> 00:35:54,607
...of the full circumference
of the Earth, 360 degrees.

461
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:59,345
Eratosthenes knew the distance
between Alexandria and Syene.

462
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:01,523
He knew it was 800 kilometers.

463
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:06,320
Why? Because he hired a man
to pace out the entire distance...

464
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,986
...so that he could perform
the calculation I'm talking about.

465
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:14,932
Now, 800 kilometers times 50
is 40,000 kilometers.

466
00:36:15,137 --> 00:36:17,230
That must be the circumference
of the Earth.

467
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:20,636
That's how far it is to go
once around the Earth.

468
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,577
That's the right answer.

469
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:25,110
Eratosthenes' only tools were...

470
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:29,182
...sticks, eyes, feet and brains.

471
00:36:29,718 --> 00:36:32,744
Plus a zest for experiment.

472
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:37,186
With those tools, he correctly deduced
the circumference of the Earth...

473
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:41,852
...to high precision with an error
of only a few percent.

474
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:47,902
That's pretty good figuring
for 2200 years ago.

475
00:36:58,247 --> 00:37:01,978
Then, as now, the Mediterranean was
teeming with ships.

476
00:37:02,184 --> 00:37:06,280
Merchantmen, fishing vessels,
naval flotillas.

477
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:10,857
But there were also
courageous voyages into the unknown.

478
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:16,891
400 years before Eratosthenes,
Africa was circumnavigated...

479
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:20,034
...by a Phoenician fleet
in the employ...

480
00:37:20,235 --> 00:37:22,294
...of the Egyptian pharaoh Necho.

481
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:23,698
They set sail...

482
00:37:23,906 --> 00:37:28,434
...probably in boats as frail
and open as these...

483
00:37:28,644 --> 00:37:31,841
...out from the Red Sea,
down the east coast of Africa...

484
00:37:32,047 --> 00:37:35,312
...up into the Atlantic and then
back through the Mediterranean.

485
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:38,413
That epic journey took three years...

486
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,747
...about as long as
it takes Voyager...

487
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:43,948
...to journey from Earth to Saturn.

488
00:37:44,526 --> 00:37:47,154
After Eratosthenes,
some may have attempted...

489
00:37:47,362 --> 00:37:49,728
...to circumnavigate the Earth.

490
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:52,833
But until the time of Magellan,
no one succeeded.

491
00:37:53,435 --> 00:37:56,427
What tales of adventure and daring...

492
00:37:56,638 --> 00:37:58,765
...must earlier have been told...

493
00:37:58,974 --> 00:38:03,308
...as sailors and navigators,
practical men of the world...

494
00:38:03,512 --> 00:38:06,379
...gambled their lives
on the mathematics...

495
00:38:06,582 --> 00:38:10,018
...of a scientist
from ancient Alexandria.

496
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:20,288
Today, Alexandria shows few traces
of its ancient glory...

497
00:38:20,495 --> 00:38:23,828
...of the days when Eratosthenes
walked its broad avenues.

498
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:28,696
Over the centuries, waves of conquerors
converted its palaces and temples...

499
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:33,671
...into castles and churches,
then into minarets and mosques.

500
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:39,413
The city was chosen to be the capital
of his empire by Alexander the Great...

501
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:43,574
...on a winter's afternoon in 331 B.C.

502
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:47,452
A century later, it had become
the greatest city of the world.

503
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:51,387
Each successive civilization
has left its mark.

504
00:38:57,332 --> 00:39:01,792
But what now remains of the
marvel city of Alexander's dream?

505
00:39:03,272 --> 00:39:06,173
Alexandria is still
a thriving marketplace...

506
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:09,640
...still a crossroads
for the peoples of the Near East.

507
00:39:16,118 --> 00:39:19,281
But once, it was radiant
with self-confidence...

508
00:39:19,488 --> 00:39:21,752
...certain of its power.

509
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,423
Can you recapture a vanished epoch...

510
00:39:30,632 --> 00:39:35,001
...from a few broken statues and scraps
of ancient manuscripts?

511
00:39:42,678 --> 00:39:46,205
In Alexandria, there was
an immense library...

512
00:39:46,415 --> 00:39:49,043
...and an associated
research institute.

513
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:53,381
And in them worked the finest minds
in the ancient world.

(CAN CLUNKS)

515
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:01,661
(DOOR SQUEAKS)

516
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:16,410
Of that legendary library...

517
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:19,171
...all that survives is this...

518
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:22,077
...dank and forgotten cellar.

519
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:26,954
It's in the library annex,
the Serapeum...

520
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:29,123
...which was once a temple...

521
00:40:29,324 --> 00:40:32,122
...but was later reconsecrated
to knowledge.

522
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:36,358
These few moldering shelves...

523
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:39,199
...probably once in a basement
storage room...

524
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:42,097
...are its only physical remains.

525
00:40:42,471 --> 00:40:45,235
But this place was once...

526
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,407
...the brain and glory...

527
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,738
...of the greatest city
on the planet Earth.

528
00:40:59,755 --> 00:41:02,349
If I could travel back into time...

529
00:41:02,557 --> 00:41:05,082
...this is the place I would visit.

530
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:10,488
The Library of Alexandria
at its height, 2000 years ago.

531
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:17,003
Here, in an important sense...

532
00:41:17,205 --> 00:41:21,505
...began the intellectual adventure
which has led us into space.

533
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:33,053
All the knowledge in the ancient world
was once within these marble walls.

534
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:42,619
In the great hall, there may have
been a mural of Alexander...

535
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:46,062
...with the crook and flail
and ceremonial headdress...

536
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:48,896
...of the pharaohs of ancient Egypt.

537
00:41:52,507 --> 00:41:55,999
This library was a citadel
of human consciousness...

538
00:41:56,211 --> 00:42:00,307
...a beacon on our journey
to the stars.

539
00:42:03,652 --> 00:42:08,521
It was the first true research
institute in the history of the world.

540
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,724
And what did they study?

541
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:14,962
They studied everything.
The entire cosmos.

542
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:19,566
"Cosmos" is a Greek word
for the order of the universe.

543
00:42:19,768 --> 00:42:22,862
In a way, it's the opposite of chaos.

544
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:28,008
It implies a deep interconnectedness
of all things.

545
00:42:28,443 --> 00:42:33,380
The intricate and subtle way
that the universe is put together.

546
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:37,512
Genius flourished here.

547
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:42,053
In addition to Eratosthenes,
there was the astronomer Hipparchus...

548
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:44,020
...who mapped the constellation...

549
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:47,252
...and established the brightness
of the stars.

550
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:49,988
And there was Euclid...

551
00:42:50,198 --> 00:42:53,031
...who brilliantly
systematized geometry...

552
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:55,601
...who told his king,
who was struggling...

553
00:42:55,804 --> 00:42:58,432
...with some difficult problem
in mathematics...

554
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,009
...that there was no royal road
to geometry.

555
00:43:03,545 --> 00:43:06,241
There was Dionysius of Thrace,
the man who defined...

556
00:43:06,448 --> 00:43:09,906
...the parts of speech:
nouns, verbs and so on...

557
00:43:10,118 --> 00:43:14,054
...who did for language, in a way,
what Euclid did for geometry.

558
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:18,283
There was Herophilus,
a physiologist who identified...

559
00:43:18,493 --> 00:43:22,020
...the brain rather than the heart
as the seat of intelligence.

560
00:43:22,697 --> 00:43:25,393
There was Archimedes,
the greatest mechanical genius...

561
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,795
...until the time
of Leonardo da Vinci.

562
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:32,736
And there was the astronomer Ptolemy,
who compiled much of what today is...

563
00:43:32,941 --> 00:43:35,205
...the pseudoscience of astrology.

564
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,742
His Earth-centered universe...

565
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:40,608
...held sway for 1 500 years...

566
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:44,251
...showing that intellectual brilliance
is no guarantee...

567
00:43:44,452 --> 00:43:46,545
...against being dead wrong.

568
00:43:47,022 --> 00:43:51,015
And among these great men,
there was also a great woman.

569
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:53,421
Her name was Hypatia.

570
00:43:53,628 --> 00:43:56,495
She was a mathematician
and an astronomer...

571
00:43:56,698 --> 00:43:58,689
...the last light of the library...

572
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,803
...whose martyrdom is bound up with
the destruction of this place...

573
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:07,304
...seven centuries after
it was founded.

574
00:44:25,694 --> 00:44:27,958
Look at this place.

575
00:44:29,164 --> 00:44:32,065
The Greek kings of Egypt
who succeeded Alexander...

576
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:35,600
...regarded advances in science,
literature and medicine...

577
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:38,068
...as among the treasures
of the empire.

578
00:44:38,273 --> 00:44:42,733
For centuries, they generously
supported research and scholarship.

579
00:44:42,944 --> 00:44:47,347
An enlightenment shared by
few heads of state, then or now.

580
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:53,120
(FOUNTAIN GURGLES)

581
00:44:56,825 --> 00:45:00,784
Off this great hall were
1 0 large research laboratories.

582
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:05,126
There were fountains and colonnades,
botanical gardens...

583
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:09,702
...and even a zoo with animals
from India and sub-Saharan Africa.

584
00:45:09,904 --> 00:45:14,603
There were dissecting rooms
and an astronomical observatory.

585
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:18,442
But the treasure of the library...

586
00:45:18,647 --> 00:45:21,912
...consecrated to the god Serapis...

587
00:45:22,117 --> 00:45:24,915
...built in the city of Alexander...

588
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,951
...was its collection of books.

589
00:45:27,155 --> 00:45:29,350
The organizers of the library combed...

590
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:32,788
...all the cultures and languages
of the world for books.

591
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:36,361
They sent agents abroad
to buy up libraries.

592
00:45:36,564 --> 00:45:41,501
Commercial ships docking in Alexandria
harbor were searched by the police...

593
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:44,170
...not for contraband, but for books.

594
00:45:44,372 --> 00:45:47,933
The scrolls were borrowed, copied
and returned to their owners.

595
00:45:48,143 --> 00:45:52,204
Until studied, these scrolls were
collected in great stacks...

596
00:45:52,414 --> 00:45:55,679
...called, "books from the ships."

597
00:45:55,984 --> 00:45:58,418
Accurate numbers are
difficult to come by...

598
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,612
...but it seems that the library
contained at its peak...

599
00:46:01,823 --> 00:46:04,917
...nearly one million scrolls.

600
00:46:18,473 --> 00:46:21,909
The papyrus reed grows in Egypt.

601
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,305
It's the origin of our word
for "paper."

602
00:46:24,512 --> 00:46:28,278
Each of those million volumes
which once existed in this library...

603
00:46:28,483 --> 00:46:32,920
...were handwritten
on papyrus manuscript scrolls.

604
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:35,753
What happened to all those books?

605
00:46:35,957 --> 00:46:39,393
The classical civilization
that created them disintegrated.

606
00:46:39,594 --> 00:46:42,085
The library itself was destroyed.

607
00:46:42,297 --> 00:46:45,460
Only a small fraction
of the works survived.

608
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:48,795
And as for the rest,
we're left only with pathetic...

609
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:51,164
...scattered fragments.

610
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:55,772
But how tantalizing those remaining
bits and pieces are.

611
00:46:55,977 --> 00:46:59,640
For example, we know
that there once existed here...

612
00:46:59,848 --> 00:47:04,182
...a book by the astronomer
Aristarchus of Samos...

613
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:08,516
...who apparently argued that
the Earth was one of the planets...

614
00:47:08,723 --> 00:47:12,215
...that, like the other planets,
it orbits the sun...

615
00:47:12,427 --> 00:47:16,796
...and that the stars are
enormously far away.

616
00:47:17,165 --> 00:47:19,633
All absolutely correct.

617
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:22,462
But we had to wait
nearly 2000 years...

618
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,833
...for these facts to be rediscovered.

619
00:47:32,914 --> 00:47:36,714
The astronomy stacks
of the Alexandria Library.

620
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,419
Hipparchus.

621
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:42,416
Ptolomeus. Here we are.

622
00:47:43,792 --> 00:47:46,625
Aristarchus.

623
00:47:47,695 --> 00:47:49,162
This is the book.

624
00:47:49,364 --> 00:47:52,595
How I'd love to be able
to read this book...

625
00:47:52,934 --> 00:47:55,903
...to know how Aristarchus
figured it out.

626
00:47:56,104 --> 00:47:59,471
But it's gone. Utterly and forever.

627
00:47:59,941 --> 00:48:04,310
If we multiply our sense of loss
for this work of Aristarchus...

628
00:48:04,512 --> 00:48:05,911
...by 1 00,000...

629
00:48:06,114 --> 00:48:08,582
...we begin to appreciate
the grandeur...

630
00:48:08,783 --> 00:48:11,445
...of the achievement
of classical civilization...

631
00:48:11,853 --> 00:48:14,720
...and the tragedy of its destruction.

632
00:48:18,226 --> 00:48:22,754
We have far surpassed the science
known to the ancient world...

633
00:48:22,964 --> 00:48:26,559
...but there are irreparable gaps
in our historical knowledge.

634
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:30,168
Imagine what mysteries of the past
could be solved...

635
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:32,805
...with a borrower's card
to this library.

636
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:37,239
For example, we know of a three-volume
history of the world...

637
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:41,939
...now lost, written by
a Babylonian priest named Berossus.

638
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:45,779
Volume I dealt with the interval
from the creation of the world...

639
00:48:45,987 --> 00:48:47,147
...to the Great Flood.

640
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:51,416
A period that he took
to be 432,000 years...

641
00:48:51,626 --> 00:48:55,357
...or about 1 00 times longer than
the Old Testament chronology.

642
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:59,465
What wonders were in
the books of Berossus!

643
00:49:00,568 --> 00:49:04,595
But why have I brought you
across 2000 years...

644
00:49:04,806 --> 00:49:07,036
...to the Library of Alexandria?

645
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:11,108
Because this was when and where
we humans...

646
00:49:11,312 --> 00:49:15,408
...first collected
seriously and systematically...

647
00:49:15,617 --> 00:49:17,551
...the knowledge of the world.

648
00:49:17,852 --> 00:49:20,343
This is the Earth
as Eratosthenes knew it.

649
00:49:20,555 --> 00:49:23,820
A tiny, spherical world, afloat...

650
00:49:24,025 --> 00:49:27,017
...in an immensity of space and time.

651
00:49:27,495 --> 00:49:30,191
We were, at long last,
beginning to find...

652
00:49:30,398 --> 00:49:33,333
...our true bearings in the cosmos.

653
00:49:34,102 --> 00:49:35,967
The scientists of antiquity...

654
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:39,765
...took the first and most
important steps in that direction...

655
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:42,738
...before their civilization
fell apart.

656
00:49:43,044 --> 00:49:45,911
But after the Dark Ages,
it was by and large...

657
00:49:46,114 --> 00:49:50,050
...the rediscovery of the works
of these scholars done here...

658
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:52,446
...that made
the Renaissance possible...

659
00:49:52,654 --> 00:49:55,714
...and thereby powerfully influenced
our own culture.

660
00:49:55,924 --> 00:49:59,155
When, in the 1 5th century,
Europe was at last ready...

661
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,158
...to awaken from its long sleep...

662
00:50:02,363 --> 00:50:06,629
...it picked up some of the tools,
the books and the concepts...

663
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:10,861
...laid down here more than
a thousand years before.

664
00:50:16,311 --> 00:50:20,213
By 1600, the long-forgotten ideas
of Aristarchus...

665
00:50:20,415 --> 00:50:21,643
...had been rediscovered.

666
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:25,982
Johannes Kepler constructed
elaborate models...

667
00:50:26,187 --> 00:50:29,088
...to understand the motion
and arrangement of the planets...

668
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:31,952
...the clockwork of the heavens.

669
00:50:36,064 --> 00:50:39,898
And at night, he dreamt
of traveling to the moon.

670
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:52,807
His principal
scientific tools were...

671
00:50:53,014 --> 00:50:55,812
...the mathematics
of the Alexandrian Library...

672
00:50:56,017 --> 00:50:58,451
...and an unswerving respect
for the facts...

673
00:50:58,653 --> 00:51:02,089
...however disquieting they might be.

674
00:51:05,493 --> 00:51:08,929
His story, and the story of
the scientists who came after him...

675
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,564
...are also part of our voyage.

676
00:51:13,935 --> 00:51:16,904
Seventy years later,
the sun-centered universe...

677
00:51:17,105 --> 00:51:18,697
...of Aristarchus and Copernicus...

678
00:51:18,906 --> 00:51:22,774
...was widely accepted
in the Europe of the Enlightenment.

679
00:51:22,977 --> 00:51:26,413
The idea arose that the planets
were worlds...

680
00:51:26,614 --> 00:51:28,241
...governed by laws of nature...

681
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:32,681
...and scientific speculation turned
to the motions of the stars.

682
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:35,515
The clockwork in the heavens
was imitated...

683
00:51:35,723 --> 00:51:37,486
...by the watchmakers of Earth.

684
00:51:38,092 --> 00:51:41,584
Precise timekeeping permitted
great sailing ship voyages...

685
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:44,321
...of exploration and discovery...

686
00:51:44,532 --> 00:51:46,090
...which bound up the Earth.

687
00:51:48,536 --> 00:51:50,868
This was a time when free inquiry...

688
00:51:51,072 --> 00:51:53,040
...was valued once again.

689
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:57,507
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

690
00:51:59,947 --> 00:52:03,348
250 years later,
the Earth was all explored.

691
00:52:03,551 --> 00:52:06,714
New adventurers now looked to
the planets and the stars.

692
00:52:07,455 --> 00:52:11,118
The galaxies were recognized
as great aggregates of stars...

693
00:52:11,325 --> 00:52:15,261
...island universes
millions of light years away.

694
00:52:16,164 --> 00:52:19,292
In the 1920s, astronomers had
begun to measure...

695
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,230
...the speeds of distant galaxies.

696
00:52:27,008 --> 00:52:27,975
ASTRONOMER 1:
What time is it?

697
00:52:28,176 --> 00:52:29,871
7:1 5.

698
00:52:30,311 --> 00:52:31,471
ASTRONOMER 1:
Lights off, please.

699
00:52:32,447 --> 00:52:37,077
They found that the galaxies were
flying away from one another.

700
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:39,185
To the astonishment of everyone...

701
00:52:39,387 --> 00:52:42,618
...the entire universe was expanding.

702
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:53,230
We had begun to plumb the true depths
of time and space.

703
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:58,366
The long, collective enterprise
of science...

704
00:52:58,573 --> 00:53:02,873
...has revealed a universe
some 1 5 billion years old.

705
00:53:03,077 --> 00:53:06,069
The time since the explosive
birth of the cosmos...

706
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,577
...the big bang.

707
00:53:07,882 --> 00:53:10,043
(THUNDER CRASHES)

708
00:53:14,021 --> 00:53:18,048
The cosmic calendar compresses
the local history of the universe...

709
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:19,988
...into a single year.

710
00:53:20,194 --> 00:53:22,754
If the universe began
on January 1st...

711
00:53:22,964 --> 00:53:26,331
...it was not until May
that the Milky Way formed.

712
00:53:27,101 --> 00:53:29,865
Other planetary systems
may have appeared...

713
00:53:30,071 --> 00:53:32,869
...in June, July and August...

714
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:35,971
...but our sun and Earth,
not until mid-September.

715
00:53:36,177 --> 00:53:38,543
Life arose soon after.

716
00:53:39,413 --> 00:53:43,474
Everything humans have ever done
occurred in that bright speck...

717
00:53:43,684 --> 00:53:46,744
...at the lower right
of the cosmic calendar.

718
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:51,381
The big bang is at upper left...

719
00:53:51,592 --> 00:53:54,288
...in the first second of January 1st.

720
00:53:54,562 --> 00:53:58,259
Fifteen billion years later
is our present time...

721
00:53:58,466 --> 00:54:01,833
...the last second of December 31st.

722
00:54:06,808 --> 00:54:10,039
Every month is
1 billion years long.

723
00:54:10,244 --> 00:54:13,145
Each day represents 40 million years.

724
00:54:13,347 --> 00:54:17,078
Each second stands for some 500 years
of our history.

725
00:54:17,285 --> 00:54:21,517
The blinking of an eye
in the drama of cosmic time.

726
00:54:26,894 --> 00:54:31,354
At this scale, the cosmic calendar
is the size of a football field...

727
00:54:31,566 --> 00:54:34,729
...but all of human history
would occupy an area...

728
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:36,563
...the size of my hand.

729
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:40,229
We're just beginning to trace
the long and tortuous path...

730
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:43,171
...which began with
the primeval fireball...

731
00:54:43,377 --> 00:54:46,073
...and led to the condensation
of matter:

732
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,908
Gas, dust, stars, galaxies, and...

733
00:54:49,116 --> 00:54:51,482
...at least in our little nook
of the universe...

734
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:55,986
...planets, life, intelligence
and inquisitive men and women.

735
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,782
We've emerged so recently...

736
00:54:57,992 --> 00:55:00,859
...that the familiar events
of our recorded history...

737
00:55:01,062 --> 00:55:05,294
...occupy only the last seconds
of the last minute of December 31st.

738
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:09,128
But some critical events for the
human species began much earlier...

739
00:55:09,337 --> 00:55:11,100
...minutes earlier.

740
00:55:12,373 --> 00:55:15,774
So we change our scale
from months to minutes.

741
00:55:15,977 --> 00:55:19,140
Down here, the first humans
made their debut...

742
00:55:19,347 --> 00:55:22,839
...around 10:30 p.m. on December 31st.

743
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,052
And with the passing
of every cosmic minute...

744
00:55:28,256 --> 00:55:30,315
...each minute 30,000 years long...

745
00:55:30,524 --> 00:55:32,856
...we began the arduous journey
towards understanding...

746
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,722
...where we live and who we are.

747
00:55:38,566 --> 00:55:40,659
11:46...

748
00:55:40,868 --> 00:55:43,428
...only 14 minutes ago...

749
00:55:43,704 --> 00:55:46,673
...humans have tamed fire.

750
00:55:47,408 --> 00:55:52,209
11:59:20, the evening
of the last day of the cosmic year...

751
00:55:52,413 --> 00:55:56,247
...the 11th hour, the 59th minute,
the 20th second...

752
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:59,317
...the domestication of
plants and animals begins:

753
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,421
An application of the human talent...

754
00:56:05,293 --> 00:56:07,022
...for making tools.

755
00:56:14,235 --> 00:56:18,729
11:59:35, settled agricultural
communities...

756
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,670
...evolved into the first cities.

757
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:26,706
We humans appear on
the comic calendar so recently...

758
00:56:26,914 --> 00:56:29,314
...that our recorded history
occupies only...

759
00:56:29,517 --> 00:56:34,454
...the last few seconds of
the last minute of December 31 st.

760
00:56:35,189 --> 00:56:39,956
In the vast ocean of time
which this calendar represents...

761
00:56:40,161 --> 00:56:43,528
...all our memories are confined...

762
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,930
...to this small square.

763
00:56:48,302 --> 00:56:53,171
Every person we've ever heard of
lived somewhere in there.

764
00:56:53,607 --> 00:56:58,544
All those kings and battles, migrations
and inventions, wars and loves.

765
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,743
Everything in the history books...

766
00:57:00,948 --> 00:57:02,882
...happens here...

767
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:06,982
...in the last 10 seconds
of the cosmic calendar.

768
00:57:12,426 --> 00:57:14,917
We on Earth have just awakened...

769
00:57:15,129 --> 00:57:17,927
...to the great oceans
of space and time...

770
00:57:18,132 --> 00:57:20,100
...from which we have emerged.

771
00:57:21,402 --> 00:57:22,960
We are the legacy...

772
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:26,662
...of 15 billion years
of cosmic evolution.

773
00:57:27,308 --> 00:57:29,003
We have a choice:

774
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:32,802
We can enhance life and come to know
the universe that made us...

775
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:36,245
...or we can squander
our 15 billion-year heritage...

776
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:39,385
...in meaningless self-destruction.

777
00:57:40,621 --> 00:57:43,818
What happens in the first second
of the next cosmic year...

778
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:47,188
...depends on what we do,
here and now...

779
00:57:47,395 --> 00:57:49,192
...with our intelligence...

780
00:57:49,397 --> 00:57:52,423
...and our knowledge of the cosmos.
