title: Cosmos (1980)
description: Astronomer Dr. Carl Sagan is host and narrator of this 13-hour series that originally aired on Public Broadcasting Stations in the United States. Dr. Sagan describes the universe in a way that appeals to a mass audience, by using Earth as a reference point, by speaking in terms intelligible to non-scientific people, by relating the exploration of space to that of the Earth by pioneers of old, and by citing such Earth legends as the Library of Alexandria as metaphors for space-related future events. Among Dr. Sagan's favorite topics are the origins of life, the search for life on Mars, the infernal composition of the atmosphere of Venus and a warning about a similar effect taking place on Earth due to global pollution and the "greenhouse effect", the lives of stars, interstellar travel and the effects of attaining the speed of light, the danger of mankind technologically self-destructing, and the search, using radio technology, for intelligent life in deep space.

            Hello. My name is Ann Druyan.

            When Carl Sagan, Steven Soter and I...

            ...wrote the Cosmos TV series
            in the late 1970s...

            ...a lot of things were different.

            Back then, the U.S. and the Soviet Union...

            ...held the hole planet
            in their perpetual hostage crisis...

            ...called the Cold War.

            The wealth and scientific ingenuity
            of our civilization...

            ...was being squandered
            on a runaway arms raise.

            Then employed half the world scientists...

            ...and infested the world
            with 50.000 nuclear weapons.



            So much has happened since then.

            The Cold War is history...

            ...and science has made great strides.

            We've completed the spacecraft
            recognizance of the Solar System...

            ...the preliminary mapping of the visible
            universe that surrounds us...

            ...and we've charted the universe within:
            the human genome.

            When Cosmos was first broadcast
            there was no World Wide Web...

            ...it was a different world.

            What a tribute to Carl Sagan...

            ...a scientist who took many a punch
            for daring to speculate...

            ...that even after 20 of the most eventful
            years in the history of science...

            ...Cosmos requires few revisions
            and indeed is rich in prophecy.

            Cosmos is both the history
            of the scientific enterprise...

            ...and an attempt
            to convey the spiritual high...



            ...of its central revelation:

            Our oneness with the universe.

            Now, please, enjoy Cosmos,
            the proud saga of how...

            ...through the searching of 40.000
            generations of our ancestors...

            ...we have come to discover
            our coordinates...

            ...in space and in time.

            And how, through the awesomely
            powerful method of science...

            ...we have been able to reconstruct
            the sweep of cosmic evolution...

            ...and defined our own part
            in its great story.

            SAGAN:
            The cosmos is all that is...

            ...or ever was or ever will be.

            Our contemplations of
            the cosmos stir us.

            There is a tingling in the spine,
            a catch in the voice...

            ...a faint sensation,
            as if a distant memory...

            ...of falling from a great height.

            We know we are approaching
            the grandest of mysteries.

            The size and age of the cosmos...

            ...are beyond ordinary
            human understanding.

            Lost somewhere between
            immensity and eternity...

            ...is our tiny planetary home,
            the Earth.

            For the first time,
            we have the power to decide...

            ...the fate of our planet
            and ourselves.

            This is a time of great danger.

            But our species is
            young and curious and brave.

            It shows much promise.

            In the last few millennia,
            we've made...

            ...the most astonishing
            and unexpected discoveries...

            ...about the cosmos
            and our place within it.

            I believe our future depends
            powerfully on...

            ...how well we understand
            this cosmos...

            ...in which we float
            like a mote of dust...

            ...in the morning sky.

            (SEAGULL CHIRPS)

            We're about to begin a journey
            through the cosmos.

            We'll encounter galaxies and suns
            and planets...

            ...life and consciousness...

            ...coming into being,
            evolving and perishing.

            Worlds of ice and stars of diamond.

            Atoms as massive as suns...

            ...and universes smaller than atoms.

            But it's also a story
            of our own planet...

            ...and the plants and animals
            that share it with us.

            And it's a story about us:

            How we achieved our present
            understanding of the cosmos...

            ...how the cosmos has shaped
            our evolution and our culture...

            ...and what our fate may be.

            We wish to pursue the truth,
            no matter where it leads.

            But to find the truth, we need
            imagination and skepticism both.

            We will not be afraid to speculate.

            But we will be careful to distinguish
            speculation from fact.

            The cosmos is full beyond measure
            of elegant truths...

            ...of exquisite interrelationships...

            ...of the awesome machinery of nature.

            The surface of the Earth is
            the shore of the cosmic ocean.

            On this shore, we have learned
            most of what we know.

            Recently, we've waded
            a little way out...

            ...maybe ankle-deep,
            and the water seems inviting.

            Some part of our being knows
            this is where we came from.

            We long to return.

            And we can.

            Because the cosmos is also within us.
            We're made of star-stuff.

            We are a way for the cosmos
            to know itself.

            The journey for each of us
            begins here.

            We're going to explore the cosmos
            in a ship of the imagination...

            ...unfettered by ordinary limits
            on speed and size...

            ...drawn by the music
            of cosmic harmonies...

            ...it can take us anywhere
            in space and time.

            Perfect as a snowflake...

            ...organic as a dandelion seed...

            ...it will carry us...

            ...to worlds of dreams
            and worlds of facts.

            Come with me.

            Before us is the cosmos
            on the grandest scale we know.

            We are far from the shores of Earth...

            ...in the uncharted reaches
            of the cosmic ocean.

            Strewn like sea froth
            on the waves of space...

            ...are innumerable
            faint tendrils of light.

            Some of them containing hundreds...

            ...of billions of suns.

            These are the galaxies...

            ...drifting endlessly
            in the great cosmic dark.

            In our ship of the imagination...

            ...we are halfway to the edge
            of the known universe.

            In this, the first of
            our cosmic voyages...

            ...we begin to explore the universe
            revealed by science.

            Our course will eventually carry us
            to a far-off and exotic world.

            But from the depths of space,
            we cannot detect even...

            ...the cluster of galaxies
            in which our Milky Way is embedded...

            ...much less the sun or the Earth.

            We are in the realm
            of the galaxies...

            ...8 billion light years from home.

            No matter where we travel,
            the patterns of nature are the same...

            ...as in the form
            of this spiral galaxy.

            The same laws of physics
            apply everywhere...

            ...throughout the cosmos.

            But we have just begun to
            understand these laws.

            The universe is rich in mystery.

            Near the center of
            a cluster of galaxies...

            ...there's sometimes a rogue,
            elliptical galaxy...

            ...made of a trillion suns...

            ...which devours its neighbors.

            Perhaps this cyclone of stars...

            ...is what astronomers on Earth
            call a quasar.

            Our ordinary measures
            of distance fail us...

            ...here in the realm of the galaxies.

            We need a much larger unit:
            the light year.

            It measures how far
            light travels in a year...

            ...nearly 10 trillion kilometers.

            It measures not time,
            but enormous distances.

            In the Hercules cluster...

            ...the individual galaxies are
            about 300,000 light years apart.

            So light takes about 300,000 years...

            ...to go from one galaxy to another.

            Like stars and planets and people...

            ...galaxies are born, live and die.

            They may all experience
            a tumultuous adolescence.

            During their first 100 million years,
            their cores may explode.

            Seen in radio light,
            great jets of energy...

            ...pour out and echo
            across the cosmos.

            Worlds near the core or along
            the jets would be incinerated.

            I wonder how many planets
            and how many civilizations...

            ...might be destroyed.

            In the Pegasus cluster,
            there's a ring galaxy...

            ...the wreckage left from
            the collision of two galaxies.

            A splash in the cosmic pond.

            Individual galaxies may
            explode and collide...

            ...and their constituent stars
            may blow up as well.

            In this supernova explosion...

            ...a single star outshines
            the rest of its galaxy.

            We are approaching what
            astronomers on Earth call...

            ...the Local Group.

            Three million light years across,
            it contains some 20 galaxies.

            It's a sparse and rather typical
            chain of islands...

            ...in the immense cosmic ocean.

            We are now only 2 million
            light years from home.

            On the maps of space,
            this galaxy is called M31...

            ...the great galaxy Andromeda.

            It's a vast storm of stars
            and gas and dust.

            As we pass over it...

            ...we see one of its small
            satellite galaxies.

            Clusters of galaxies...

            ...and the stars of
            individual galaxies...

            ...are all held together by gravity.

            Surrounding M31...

            ...are hundreds of globular
            star clusters.

            We're approaching one of them.

            Each cluster orbits the massive
            center of the galaxy.

            Some contain up to
            a million separate stars.

            Every globular cluster is
            like a swarm of bees...

            ...bound by gravity...

            ...every bee, a sun.

            From Pegasus,
            our voyage has taken us...

            ...200 million light years
            to the Local Group...

            ...dominated by two
            great spiral galaxies.

            Beyond M31 is another
            very similar galaxy.

            Its spiral arms slowly turning...

            ...once every quarter billion years.

            This is our own Milky Way...

            ...seen from the outside.

            This is the home galaxy
            of the human species.

            In the obscure backwaters
            of the Carina-Cygnus spiral arm...

            ...we humans have evolved
            to consciousness...

            ...and some measure of understanding.

            Concentrated in its brilliant core...

            ...and strewn along its spiral arms...

            ...are 400 billion suns.

            It takes light 100,000 years
            to travel...

            ...from one end of the galaxy
            to the other.

            Within this galaxy are
            stars and worlds...

            ...and, it may be, an enormous
            diversity of living things...

            ...and intelligent beings
            and space faring civilizations.

            Scattered among the stars
            of the Milky Way...

            ...are supernova remnants...

            ...each one the remains of
            a colossal stellar explosion.

            These filaments of glowing gas...

            ...are the outer layers of a star
            which has recently destroyed itself.

            The gas is unraveling...

            ...returning star-stuff
            back into space.

            (PULSAR HISSES)

            And at its heart, are the remains
            of the original star...

            ...a dense, shrunken stellar
            fragment called a pulsar.

            A natural lighthouse,
            blinking and hissing.

            A sun that spins twice each second.

            Pulsars keep such perfect time
            that the first one discovered...

            ...was thought to be a sign of
            extraterrestrial intelligence.

            Perhaps a navigational beacon...

            ...for great ships that travel
            across the light years...

            ...and between the stars.

            There may be such intelligences
            and such starships...

            ...but pulsars are not
            their signature.

            Instead, they are
            the doleful reminders...

            ...that nothing lasts forever...

            ...that stars also die.

            We continue to plummet,
            falling thousands of light years...

            ...towards the plane of the galaxy.

            This is the Milky Way...

            ...our galaxy seen edge on.

            Billions of nuclear furnaces...

            ...converting matter into starlight.

            Some stars are flimsy
            as a soap bubble.

            Others are 100 trillion times
            denser than lead.

            The hottest stars are
            destined to die young.

            But red giants are mostly elderly.

            Such stars are unlikely
            to have inhabited planets.

            But yellow dwarf stars,
            like the sun...

            ...are middle-aged
            and they are far more common.

            These stars may have
            planetary systems.

            And on such planets, for the first
            time on our cosmic voyage...

            ...we encounter rare forms of matter:

            Ice and rock, air and liquid water.

            Close to this yellow star...

            ...is a small, warm, cloudy world...

            ...with continents and oceans.

            These conditions permit an even more
            precious form of matter to arise:

            Life.

            But this is not the Earth.

            Intelligent beings have evolved
            and reworked this planetary surface...

            ...in a massive engineering
            enterprise.

            In the Milky Way galaxy,
            there may be many worlds...

            ...on which matter has
            grown to consciousness.

            I wonder, are they very
            different from us?

            What do they look like?

            What are their politics, technology,
            music, religion?

            Or do they have patterns of culture
            we can't begin to imagine?

            Are they also a danger to themselves?

            Among the many glowing clouds
            of interstellar gas...

            ...is one called the Orion Nebula...

            ...only 1500 light years from Earth.

            These three bright stars
            are seen by earthlings...

            ...as the belt in the familiar
            constellation of Orion the hunter.

            The nebula appears from Earth
            as a patch of light...

            ...the middle star in Orion's sword.

            But it is not a star.

            It is another thing entirely.

            A cloud that veils
            one of nature's secret places.

            This is a stellar nursery,
            a place where stars are born.

            They condense by gravity
            from gas and dust...

            ...until their temperatures become
            so high that they begin to shine.

            Such clouds mark
            the births of stars...

            ...as others bear witness
            to their deaths.

            After stars condense in the hidden
            interiors of interstellar clouds...

            ...what happens to them?

            The Pleiades are a loose cluster
            of young stars...

            ...only 50 million years old.

            These fledgling stars are just
            being let out into the galaxy.

            Still surrounded by wisps
            of nebulosity...

            ...the gas and dust
            from which they formed.

            There are clouds
            that hang like inkblots...

            ...between the stars.

            They are made of fine, rocky dust...

            ...organic matter and ice.

            Inside, a few stars begin to turn on.

            Nearby worlds of ice evaporate...

            ...and form long, comet-like tails...

            ...driven back by the stellar winds.

            Black clouds, light years across...

            ...drift between the stars.

            They're filled with
            organic molecules.

            The building blocks of life
            are everywhere.

            They are easily made.

            On how many worlds have such complex
            molecules assembled themselves...

            ...into patterns we would
            call alive?

            Most stars belong to systems
            of two or three or many suns...

            ...bound together by gravity.

            Each system is isolated
            from its neighbors...

            ...by the light years.

            We are approaching a single,
            ordinary, yellow dwarf star...

            ...surrounded by a system
            of nine planets...

            ...dozens of moons, thousands of
            asteroids and billions of comets:

            The family of the sun.

            Only four light hours from Earth
            is the planet Neptune...

            ...and its giant satellite, Triton.

            Even in the outskirts
            of our own solar system...

            ...we humans have barely begun
            our explorations.

            Only a century ago...

            ...we were ignorant even of
            the existence of the planet Pluto.

            Its moon, Charon, remained
            undiscovered until 1978.

            The rings of Uranus were
            first detected in 1977.

            There are new worlds to chart
            even this close to home.

            Saturn is a giant gas world.

            If it has a solid surface...

            ...it must lie far below
            the clouds we see.

            Saturn's majestic rings...

            ...are made of trillions
            of orbiting snowballs.

            We are now only 80 light minutes
            from home.

            A mere one and a half
            billion kilometers.

            The largest planet in our
            solar system is Jupiter.

            On its dark side, super bolts
            of lightning illuminate the clouds...

            ...as first revealed by
            the Voyager spacecraft in 1979.

            Inside the orbit of Jupiter...

            ...are countless shattered
            and broken world-lets:

            The asteroids.

            These reefs and shoals...

            ...mark the border of
            the realm of giant planets.

            We are now entering the shallows
            of the solar system.

            Here there are worlds with thin
            atmospheres and solid surfaces:

            Earth-like planets...

            ...with landscapes crying out
            for careful exploration.

            This world is Mars.

            In 1976, after a year's voyage...

            ...two robot explorers from Earth...

            ...landed on this alien shore.

            On Mars, there is a volcano
            as wide as Arizona...

            ...and almost three times
            the height of Mount Everest.

            We've named it Mount Olympus.

            This is a world of wonders.

            Mars is a planet with ancient
            river valleys...

            ...and violent sandstorms driven
            by winds at half the speed of sound.

            There is a giant rift in its surface
            5000 kilometers long.

            It's called Vallis Marinaris.

            The valley of
            the Mariner spacecraft...

            ...that came to explore Mars
            from a nearby world.

            In this, our first cosmic voyage...

            ...we have just begun
            the reconnaissance of Mars...

            ...and all those other planets
            and stars and galaxies.

            In voyages to come,
            we will explore them more fully.

            But now, we travel the few
            remaining light minutes...

            ...to a blue and cloudy world,
            third from the sun.

            The end of our long journey...

            ...is the world where we began.

            Our travels allow us...

            ...to see the Earth anew...

            ...as if we came from somewhere else.

            There are a hundred billion
            galaxies...

            ...and a billion trillion stars.

            Why should this modest planet
            be the only inhabited world?

            To me, it seems far more likely
            that the cosmos is brimming over...

            ...with life and intelligence.

            But so far, every living thing...

            ...every conscious being...

            ...every civilization
            we know anything about...

            ...lived there, on Earth.

            Beneath these clouds...

            ...the drama of the human species
            has been unfolded.

            We have, at last, come home.

            Welcome to the planet Earth.

            A place with blue nitrogen skies...

            ...oceans of liquid water...

            ...cool forests...

            ...soft meadows.

            A world positively rippling with life.

            In the cosmic perspective,
            it is, for the moment, unique.

            The only world in which
            we know with certainty...

            ...that the matter of the cosmos
            has become alive and aware.

            There must be many such worlds
            scattered through space...

            ...but our search for them
            begins here...

            ...with the accumulated wisdom of
            the men and women of our species...

            ...acquired at great cost...

            ...over a million years.

            There was once a time when
            our planet seemed immense.

            When it was the only world
            we could explore.

            Its true size was first worked out
            in a simple and ingenious way...

            ...by a man who lived here in Egypt,
            in the third century B.C.

            This tower may have been
            a communications tower.

            Part of a network running along
            the North African coast...

            ...by which signal bonfires were used
            to communicate messages of state.

            It also may have been used
            as a lighthouse...

            ...a navigational beacon
            for sailing ships...

            ...out there in the Mediterranean Sea.

            It is about 50 kilometers west...

            ...of what was once one of the great
            cities of the world, Alexandria.

            In Alexandria, at that time...

            ...there lived a man named
            Eratosthenes.

            A competitor called him "beta," the
            second letter of the Greek alphabet...

            ...because, he said, "Eratosthenes
            was second best in everything."

            But it seems clear, in many fields,
            Eratosthenes was "alpha."

            He was an astronomer, historian,
            geographer...

            ...philosopher, poet, theater critic
            and mathematician.

            He was also the chief librarian
            of the Great Library of Alexandria.

            And one day while reading
            a papyrus book in the library...

            ...he came upon a curious account.

            Far to the south, he read...

            ...at the frontier outpost of Syene...

            ...something notable could be seen
            on the longest day of the year.

            On June 21st...

            ...the shadows of a temple column,
            or a vertical stick...

            ...would grow shorter
            as noon approached.

            As the hours crept towards midday...

            ...the sun's rays would slither down
            the sides of a deep well...

            ...which on other days
            would remain in shadow.

            And then, precisely at noon...

            ...columns would cast no shadows.

            And the sun would shine directly down
            into the water of the well.

            At that moment...

            ...the sun was exactly overhead.

            It was an observation that someone else
            might easily have ignored.

            Sticks, shadows,
            reflections in wells...

            ...the position of the sun...

            ...simple, everyday matters.

            Of what possible importance
            might they be?

            But Eratosthenes was a scientist...

            ...and his contemplation of these
            homely matters changed the world...

            ...in a way, made the world.

            Because Eratosthenes had
            the presence of mind to experiment...

            ...to actually ask whether
            back here, near Alexandria...

            ...a stick cast a shadow
            near noon on June the 21 st.

            And it turns out, sticks do.

            An overly skeptical person
            might have said...

            ...that the report from Syene
            was an error.

            But it's an absolutely
            straightforward observation.

            Why would anyone lie
            on such a trivial matter?

            Eratosthenes asked himself
            how it could be...

            ...that at the same moment...

            ...a stick in Syene
            would cast no shadow...

            ...and a stick in Alexandria,
            800 kilometers to the north...

            ...would cast a very definite shadow.

            Here is a map of ancient Egypt.

            I've inserted two sticks, or obelisks.

            One up here in Alexandria
            and one down here in Syene.

            Now, if at a certain moment
            each stick casts...

            ...no shadow, no shadow at all...

            ...that's perfectly easy to understand,
            provided the Earth is flat.

            If the shadow at Syene is
            at a certain length...

            ...and the shadow at Alexandria is
            the same length...

            ...that also makes sense
            on a flat Earth.

            But how could it be,
            Eratosthenes asked...

            ...that at the same instant
            there was no shadow at Syene...

            ...and a very substantial shadow
            at Alexandria?

            The only answer was that
            the surface of the Earth is curved.

            Not only that...

            ...but the greater the curvature,
            the bigger the difference...

            ...in the lengths of the shadows.
            The sun is so far away...

            ...that its rays are parallel
            when they reach the Earth.

            Sticks at different angles to the sun
            will cast shadows at different lengths.

            For the observed difference
            in the shadow lengths...

            ...the distance between
            Alexandria and Syene...

            ...had to be about seven degrees
            along the surface of the Earth.

            By that, I mean, if you would imagine
            these sticks extending...

            ...all the way down
            to the center of the Earth...

            ...they would there intersect
            at an angle of seven degrees.

            Well, seven degrees is
            something like a 50th...

            ...of the full circumference
            of the Earth, 360 degrees.

            Eratosthenes knew the distance
            between Alexandria and Syene.

            He knew it was 800 kilometers.

            Why? Because he hired a man
            to pace out the entire distance...

            ...so that he could perform
            the calculation I'm talking about.

            Now, 800 kilometers times 50
            is 40,000 kilometers.

            That must be the circumference
            of the Earth.

            That's how far it is to go
            once around the Earth.

            That's the right answer.

            Eratosthenes' only tools were...

            ...sticks, eyes, feet and brains.

            Plus a zest for experiment.

            With those tools, he correctly deduced
            the circumference of the Earth...

            ...to high precision with an error
            of only a few percent.

            That's pretty good figuring
            for 2200 years ago.

            Then, as now, the Mediterranean was
            teeming with ships.

            Merchantmen, fishing vessels,
            naval flotillas.

            But there were also
            courageous voyages into the unknown.

            400 years before Eratosthenes,
            Africa was circumnavigated...

            ...by a Phoenician fleet
            in the employ...

            ...of the Egyptian pharaoh Necho.

            They set sail...

            ...probably in boats as frail
            and open as these...

            ...out from the Red Sea,
            down the east coast of Africa...

            ...up into the Atlantic and then
            back through the Mediterranean.

            That epic journey took three years...

            ...about as long as
            it takes Voyager...

            ...to journey from Earth to Saturn.

            After Eratosthenes,
            some may have attempted...

            ...to circumnavigate the Earth.

            But until the time of Magellan,
            no one succeeded.

            What tales of adventure and daring...

            ...must earlier have been told...

            ...as sailors and navigators,
            practical men of the world...

            ...gambled their lives
            on the mathematics...

            ...of a scientist
            from ancient Alexandria.

            Today, Alexandria shows few traces
            of its ancient glory...

            ...of the days when Eratosthenes
            walked its broad avenues.

            Over the centuries, waves of conquerors
            converted its palaces and temples...

            ...into castles and churches,
            then into minarets and mosques.

            The city was chosen to be the capital
            of his empire by Alexander the Great...

            ...on a winter's afternoon in 331 B.C.

            A century later, it had become
            the greatest city of the world.

            Each successive civilization
            has left its mark.

            But what now remains of the
            marvel city of Alexander's dream?

            Alexandria is still
            a thriving marketplace...

            ...still a crossroads
            for the peoples of the Near East.

            But once, it was radiant
            with self-confidence...

            ...certain of its power.

            Can you recapture a vanished epoch...

            ...from a few broken statues and scraps
            of ancient manuscripts?

            In Alexandria, there was
            an immense library...

            ...and an associated
            research institute.

            And in them worked the finest minds
            in the ancient world.

            (CAN CLUNKS)

            (DOOR SQUEAKS)

            Of that legendary library...

            ...all that survives is this...

            ...dank and forgotten cellar.

            It's in the library annex,
            the Serapeum...

            ...which was once a temple...

            ...but was later reconsecrated
            to knowledge.

            These few moldering shelves...

            ...probably once in a basement
            storage room...

            ...are its only physical remains.

            But this place was once...

            ...the brain and glory...

            ...of the greatest city
            on the planet Earth.

            If I could travel back into time...

            ...this is the place I would visit.

            The Library of Alexandria
            at its height, 2000 years ago.

            Here, in an important sense...

            ...began the intellectual adventure
            which has led us into space.

            All the knowledge in the ancient world
            was once within these marble walls.

            In the great hall, there may have
            been a mural of Alexander...

            ...with the crook and flail
            and ceremonial headdress...

            ...of the pharaohs of ancient Egypt.

            This library was a citadel
            of human consciousness...

            ...a beacon on our journey
            to the stars.

            It was the first true research
            institute in the history of the world.

            And what did they study?

            They studied everything.
            The entire cosmos.

            "Cosmos" is a Greek word
            for the order of the universe.

            In a way, it's the opposite of chaos.

            It implies a deep interconnectedness
            of all things.

            The intricate and subtle way
            that the universe is put together.

            Genius flourished here.

            In addition to Eratosthenes,
            there was the astronomer Hipparchus...

            ...who mapped the constellation...

            ...and established the brightness
            of the stars.

            And there was Euclid...

            ...who brilliantly
            systematized geometry...

            ...who told his king,
            who was struggling...

            ...with some difficult problem
            in mathematics...

            ...that there was no royal road
            to geometry.

            There was Dionysius of Thrace,
            the man who defined...

            ...the parts of speech:
            nouns, verbs and so on...

            ...who did for language, in a way,
            what Euclid did for geometry.

            There was Herophilus,
            a physiologist who identified...

            ...the brain rather than the heart
            as the seat of intelligence.

            There was Archimedes,
            the greatest mechanical genius...

            ...until the time
            of Leonardo da Vinci.

            And there was the astronomer Ptolemy,
            who compiled much of what today is...

            ...the pseudoscience of astrology.

            His Earth-centered universe...

            ...held sway for 1500 years...

            ...showing that intellectual brilliance
            is no guarantee...

            ...against being dead wrong.

            And among these great men,
            there was also a great woman.

            Her name was Hypatia.

            She was a mathematician
            and an astronomer...

            ...the last light of the library...

            ...whose martyrdom is bound up with
            the destruction of this place...

            ...seven centuries after
            it was founded.

            Look at this place.

            The Greek kings of Egypt
            who succeeded Alexander...

            ...regarded advances in science,
            literature and medicine...

            ...as among the treasures
            of the empire.

            For centuries, they generously
            supported research and scholarship.

            An enlightenment shared by
            few heads of state, then or now.

            (FOUNTAIN GURGLES)

            Off this great hall were
            10 large research laboratories.

            There were fountains and colonnades,
            botanical gardens...

            ...and even a zoo with animals
            from India and sub-Saharan Africa.

            There were dissecting rooms
            and an astronomical observatory.

            But the treasure of the library...

            ...consecrated to the god Serapis...

            ...built in the city of Alexander...

            ...was its collection of books.

            The organizers of the library combed...

            ...all the cultures and languages
            of the world for books.

            They sent agents abroad
            to buy up libraries.

            Commercial ships docking in Alexandria
            harbor were searched by the police...

            ...not for contraband, but for books.

            The scrolls were borrowed, copied
            and returned to their owners.

            Until studied, these scrolls were
            collected in great stacks...

            ...called, "books from the ships."

            Accurate numbers are
            difficult to come by...

            ...but it seems that the library
            contained at its peak...

            ...nearly one million scrolls.

            The papyrus reed grows in Egypt.

            It's the origin of our word
            for "paper."

            Each of those million volumes
            which once existed in this library...

            ...were handwritten
            on papyrus manuscript scrolls.

            What happened to all those books?

            The classical civilization
            that created them disintegrated.

            The library itself was destroyed.

            Only a small fraction
            of the works survived.

            And as for the rest,
            we're left only with pathetic...

            ...scattered fragments.

            But how tantalizing those remaining
            bits and pieces are.

            For example, we know
            that there once existed here...

            ...a book by the astronomer
            Aristarchus of Samos...

            ...who apparently argued that
            the Earth was one of the planets...

            ...that, like the other planets,
            it orbits the sun...

            ...and that the stars are
            enormously far away.

            All absolutely correct.

            But we had to wait
            nearly 2000 years...

            ...for these facts to be rediscovered.

            The astronomy stacks
            of the Alexandria Library.

            Hipparchus.

            Ptolomeus. Here we are.

            Aristarchus.

            This is the book.

            How I'd love to be able
            to read this book...

            ...to know how Aristarchus
            figured it out.

            But it's gone. Utterly and forever.

            If we multiply our sense of loss
            for this work of Aristarchus...

            ...by 100,000...

            ...we begin to appreciate
            the grandeur...

            ...of the achievement
            of classical civilization...

            ...and the tragedy of its destruction.

            We have far surpassed the science
            known to the ancient world...

            ...but there are irreparable gaps
            in our historical knowledge.

            Imagine what mysteries of the past
            could be solved...

            ...with a borrower's card
            to this library.

            For example, we know of a three-volume
            history of the world...

            ...now lost, written by
            a Babylonian priest named Berossus.

            Volume I dealt with the interval
            from the creation of the world...

            ...to the Great Flood.

            A period that he took
            to be 432,000 years...

            ...or about 100 times longer than
            the Old Testament chronology.

            What wonders were in
            the books of Berossus!

            But why have I brought you
            across 2000 years...

            ...to the Library of Alexandria?

            Because this was when and where
            we humans...

            ...first collected
            seriously and systematically...

            ...the knowledge of the world.

            This is the Earth
            as Eratosthenes knew it.

            A tiny, spherical world, afloat...

            ...in an immensity of space and time.

            We were, at long last,
            beginning to find...

            ...our true bearings in the cosmos.

            The scientists of antiquity...

            ...took the first and most
            important steps in that direction...

            ...before their civilization
            fell apart.

            But after the Dark Ages,
            it was by and large...

            ...the rediscovery of the works
            of these scholars done here...

            ...that made
            the Renaissance possible...

            ...and thereby powerfully influenced
            our own culture.

            When, in the 15th century,
            Europe was at last ready...

            ...to awaken from its long sleep...

            ...it picked up some of the tools,
            the books and the concepts...

            ...laid down here more than
            a thousand years before.

            By 1600, the long-forgotten ideas
            of Aristarchus...

            ...had been rediscovered.

            Johannes Kepler constructed
            elaborate models...

            ...to understand the motion
            and arrangement of the planets...

            ...the clockwork of the heavens.

            And at night, he dreamt
            of traveling to the moon.

            His principal
            scientific tools were...

            ...the mathematics
            of the Alexandrian Library...

            ...and an unswerving respect
            for the facts...

            ...however disquieting they might be.

            His story, and the story of
            the scientists who came after him...

            ...are also part of our voyage.

            Seventy years later,
            the sun-centered universe...

            ...of Aristarchus and Copernicus...

            ...was widely accepted
            in the Europe of the Enlightenment.

            The idea arose that the planets
            were worlds...

            ...governed by laws of nature...

            ...and scientific speculation turned
            to the motions of the stars.

            The clockwork in the heavens
            was imitated...

            ...by the watchmakers of Earth.

            Precise timekeeping permitted
            great sailing ship voyages...

            ...of exploration and discovery...

            ...which bound up the Earth.

            This was a time when free inquiry...

            ...was valued once again.

            (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

            250 years later,
            the Earth was all explored.

            New adventurers now looked to
            the planets and the stars.

            The galaxies were recognized
            as great aggregates of stars...

            ...island universes
            millions of light years away.

            In the 1920s, astronomers had
            begun to measure...

            ...the speeds of distant galaxies.

            Lights off, please.

            They found that the galaxies were
            flying away from one another.

            To the astonishment of everyone...

            ...the entire universe was expanding.

            We had begun to plumb the true depths
            of time and space.

            The long, collective enterprise
            of science...

            ...has revealed a universe
            some 15 billion years old.

            The time since the explosive
            birth of the cosmos...

            from months to minutes.

            We can enhance life and come to know
            the universe that made us...

            ...or we can squander
            our 15 billion-year heritage...

            ...in meaningless self-destruction.

            What happens in the first second
            of the next cosmic year...

            ...depends on what we do,
            here and now...

            ...with our intelligence...

            ...and our knowledge of the cosmos.

            SAGAN: All my life I've wondered
            about life beyond the Earth.

            On those countless other planets
            that we think circle other suns...

            ...is there also life?

            Might the beings of other
            worlds resemble us...

            ...or would they be
            astonishingly different?

            What would they be made of?

            In the vast Milky Way galaxy...

            ...how common is what we call life?

            The nature of life on Earth...

            ...and the quest for life elsewhere...

            ...are the two sides
            of the same question.



            The search for who we are.

            All living things on Earth
            are made of organic molecules...

            ...a complex microscopic
            architecture...

            ...built around atoms of carbon.

            In the great dark between the stars...

            ...there also are organic molecules...

            ...in immense clouds of gas and dust.

            Inside such clouds...

            ...there are batches
            of new worlds just forming.

            Their surfaces are very likely
            covered with organic molecules.

            These molecules almost certainly
            are not made by life...

            ...although they
            are the stuff of life.

            On suitable worlds,
            they may lead to life.

            Organic matter is abundant
            throughout the cosmos...



            ...produced by the same chemistry
            everywhere.

            Perhaps, given enough time...

            ...the origin and evolution of life
            is inevitable on every clement world.

            There will surely be some planets
            too hostile for life.

            On others,
            it may arise and die out...

            ...or never evolve
            beyond its simplest forms.

            And on some small
            fraction of worlds...

            ...there may develop intelligences
            and civilizations...

            ...more advanced than ours.

            All life on our planet
            is closely related.

            We have a common organic chemistry
            and a common evolutionary heritage.

            And so our biologists
            are profoundly limited.

            They study a single biology...

            ...one lonely theme
            in the music of life.

            Is it the only voice
            for thousands of light years...

            ...or is there a cosmic fugue,
            a billion different voices...

            ...playing the life music
            of the galaxy?

            This blue world is where we grew up.

            There was once a time before life.

            Our planet is now
            burgeoning with life.

            How did it come about?

            How were organic molecules
            originally made?

            How did life evolve
            to produce beings...

            ...as elaborate and complex as we...

            ...able to explore the mystery
            of our own origins?

            Let me tell you a story
            about one little phrase...

            ...in the music of life on Earth.

            (WIND BLOWS)

            In the history of humans...

            ...in the 12th century...

            ...Japan was ruled by a clan
            of warriors called the Heike.

            The nominal leader of the Heike,
            the emperor of Japan...

            ...was a 7-year-old boy
            named Antoku.

            His guardian was his grandmother,
            the Lady Nii.

            (DRUM BEATS)

            The Heike were engaged
            in a long and bloody war...

            ...with another Samurai clan,
            the Genji.

            Each asserted
            a superior ancestral claim...

            ...to the imperial throne.

            (BATTLE CRIES)

            Their decisive encounter
            occurred at Dannoura...

            ...in the Japanese Inland Sea
            on April 24...

            ...in the year 1 185.

            The Heike were badly outnumbered
            and outmaneuvered.

            With their cause clearly lost...

            ...the surviving Heike warriors threw
            themselves into the sea and drowned.

            The emperor's grandmother,
            the Lady Nii...

            ...resolved that they would not
            be captured by the enemy.

            What happened next is related
            in "The Tale of the Heike":

            "The young emperor asked the Lady Nii,
            'Where are you to take me?'

            She turned to the youthful sovereign
            with tears streaming down her cheeks...

            ...and comforted him.

            (WATER LAPS)

            Blinded with tears...

            ...the child sovereign put his
            beautiful small hands together.

            He turned first to the east...

            ...to say farewell
            to the god of Ise...

            ...and then to the west...

            ...to recite a prayer
            to the Amida Buddha.

            The Lady Nii...

            ...took him in her arms,
            and with the words:

            'In the depths of the ocean
            is our capital'...

            ...sank with him at last
            beneath the waves."

            The destruction of the Heike
            battle fleet at Dannoura...

            ...marked the end of the clan's
            30-year rule.

            The Heike all but vanished
            from history.

            Only 43 Heike survived, all women.

            These former ladies-in-waiting
            of the Imperial Court...

            ...were reduced to selling flowers
            and other favors...

            ...to the fishermen near
            the scene of the battle.

            These women and their offspring
            by the fishermen...

            ...established a festival
            to commemorate the battle.

            To this day, every year,
            on the 24th of April...

            ...their descendants proceed
            to the Akama shrine...

            ...which contains the mausoleum...

            ...of the drowned
            7-year-old emperor, Antoku.

            There, they conduct a ceremony
            of remembrance...

            ...for the life and death
            of the Heike warriors.

            But there is a strange
            postscript to this story:

            The fishermen say...

            ...that the Heike samurai
            wander the bottom of the Inland Sea...

            ...in the form of crabs.

            There are crabs here which have
            curious markings on their backs.

            Patterns which resemble
            a human face...

            ...with the aggressive scowl
            of a samurai warrior...

            ...from medieval Japan.

            (DRUM BEATS)

            These Heike crabs, when caught,
            are not eaten.

            They are thrown back into the sea...

            ...in commemoration
            of the doleful events...

            ...of the battle of Dannoura.

            This legend raises a lovely problem:

            How does it come about that the face
            of a warrior...

            ...is cut on the carapace of
            a Japanese crab? How could it be?

            The answer seems to be
            that humans made this face.

            But how?

            Like many other features,
            the patterns on the back...

            ...or carapace of this crab
            are inherited.

            But among crabs, as among humans,
            there are different hereditary lines.

            Now, suppose purely by chance...

            ...among the distant ancestors
            of this crab...

            ...there came to be one which looked
            just a little bit like a human face.

            Long before the battle, fishermen
            may have been reluctant...

            ...to eat a crab with a human face.

            In throwing it back into the sea...

            ...they were setting into motion
            a process of selection.

            If you're a crab and your carapace
            is just ordinary...

            ...the humans are gonna eat you.

            But if it looks a little bit
            like a face...

            ...they'll throw you back and you
            can have lots of baby crabs...

            ...that all look just like you.

            As many generations passed...

            ...of crabs and fisher-folk alike...

            ...the crabs with patterns that
            looked most like a samurai face...

            ...preferentially survived.

            Until eventually, there was produced
            not just a human face...

            ...not just a Japanese face...

            ...but the face of a samurai warrior.

            All this has nothing to do
            with what the crabs might want.

            Selection is imposed from the outside.

            The more you look like a samurai,
            the better your chances of survival.

            Eventually, there are a lot of crabs
            that look like samurai warriors.

            (DRUM BEATS)

            This process is called
            artificial selection.

            In the case of the Heike crab,
            it was effected...

            ...more or less unconsciously
            by the fishermen...

            ...and certainly without any serious
            contemplation by the crabs.

            Humans, for thousands of years...

            ...have deliberately selected...

            ...which plants
            and animals shall live.

            We're surrounded
            by farm and domestic animals...

            ...fruits, vegetables.

            Where do they come from? Were they
            once free-living in the wild...

            ...and then induced to adopt some
            less strenuous life on the farm?

            No.

            They are, almost all of them,
            made by us.

            The essence of artificial selection
            for a horse or a cow...

            ...a grain of rice
            or a Heike crab, is this:

            Many characteristics are inherited.
            They breed true.

            Humans encourage the reproduction
            of some varieties...

            ...and discourage
            the reproduction of others.

            The variety selected for,
            eventually becomes abundant.

            The variety selected against,
            becomes rare, maybe extinct.

            But if artificial selection
            makes such changes...

            ...in only a few thousand years...

            ...what must natural selection...

            ...working for billions of years,
            be capable of?

            The answer...

            ...is all the beauty and diversity
            in the biological world.

            That life evolved over
            the ages is clear...

            ...from the changes we've made
            in the beasts and vegetables...

            ...but also from
            the record in the rocks.

            The fossil evidence speaks
            to us unambiguously...

            ...of creatures that were once
            present in enormous numbers...

            ...and that have now vanished utterly.

            There are more species that have
            become extinct than exist today.

            They are the terminated
            experiments in evolution.

            These guys, the trilobites,
            appeared 600 million years ago.

            They were around
            for 300 million years.

            They're all gone. There's none left.

            But in those old rocks, there are
            no fossils of people or cattle.

            We've evolved only recently.

            Evolution is a fact, not a theory.

            It really happened.

            (BEE BUZZES)

            That the mechanism of evolution is
            natural selection was the discovery...

            ...of Charles Darwin
            and Alfred Russel Wallace.

            Here's how it works:

            Nature is prolific.

            There are many more creatures that
            are born than can possibly survive.

            So those varieties which are,
            by accident, less well adapted...

            ...don't survive, or at least
            they leave fewer offspring.

            Now, mutations, sudden
            changes in heredity...

            ...are passed on. They breed true.

            The environment selects the occasional
            mutations which enhance survival.

            The resulting series of slow changes
            in the nature of living beings...

            ...is the origin of new species.

            Many people were scandalized...

            ...by the ideas of evolution
            and natural selection.

            Our ancestors looked at...

            ...the intricacy
            and the beauty of life...

            ...and saw evidence
            for a great designer.

            The simplest organism
            is a far more complex machine...

            ...than the finest pocket watch.

            And yet, pocket watches don't
            spontaneously self-assemble...

            ...or evolve in slow
            stages on their own...

            ...from say, grandfather clocks.

            A watch implies a watchmaker.

            There seemed to be no way atoms
            could spontaneously fall together...

            ...and create, say...

            ...a dandelion.

            The idea of a designer...

            ...is an appealing and altogether human
            explanation of the biological world.

            But as Darwin and Wallace showed...

            ...there's another way...

            ...equally human
            and far more compelling.

            Natural selection, which makes
            the music of life more beautiful...

            ...as the eons pass.

            (LOUD RUMBLE)

            To understand the passage
            of the eons...

            ...we have compressed all of time
            into a single cosmic year...

            ...with the big bang on January first.

            Every month here represents
            a little over a billion years.

            The Earth didn't form until
            the cosmic year was two-thirds over.

            Our understanding of the history
            of life is very recent...

            ...occupying only the last few
            seconds of December 31...

            ...that small white spot at bottom
            right in the cosmic calendar.

            What happened on Earth may be
            more or less typical...

            ...of the evolution of life
            on many worlds.

            But in its details...

            ...the story of life on Earth...

            ...is probably unique
            in all the Milky Way galaxy.

            The secrets of evolution
            are time and death.

            Time for the slow accumulation
            of favorable mutations...

            ...and death to make room
            for new species.

            Life on Earth arose in September
            of the cosmic calendar...

            ...when our world, still battered and
            cratered from its violent origin...

            ...may have looked
            a little like the moon.

            The Earth is about four and a half
            billion years old.

            In the cosmic calendar...

            ...it condensed out of interstellar
            gas and dust...

            ...around September 1 4.

            We know from the fossil record
            that life originated soon after...

            ...maybe around September 25,
            something like that...

            ...probably in the ponds and oceans
            of the primitive Earth.

            The first living things were not
            as complex as a one-celled organism...

            ...which is already a highly
            sophisticated form of life.

            No, the first stirrings
            of life were much more humble...

            ...and happened on the molecular level.

            In those early days, lightning
            and ultraviolet light from the sun...

            ...were breaking apart hydrogen-rich
            molecules in the atmosphere.

            The fragments of the molecules
            were spontaneously recombining...

            ...into more and more
            complex molecules.

            The products of this early
            chemistry dissolved in the oceans...

            ...forming a kind of organic soup...

            ...of gradually increasing complexity.

            Until one day, quite by accident...

            ...a molecule arose that was able
            to make crude copies of itself...

            ...using as building blocks
            the other molecules in the soup.

            This was the ancestor of DNA...

            ...the master molecule
            of life on Earth.

            It's made of four different
            parts, called nucleotides...

            ...which constitute the four letters
            of the genetic code...

            ...the language of heredity.

            Each of the nucleotides,
            the rungs on the DNA ladder...

            ...are a different color
            in this model.

            The instructions are different
            for different organisms.

            That's why organisms
            are different.

            Now, a mutation is a change
            of a nucleotide...

            ...a misspelling
            of the genetic instructions.

            Most mutations spell genetic
            nonsense since they're random.

            They harm the next generation.

            But a very few, by accident...

            ...make better sense than the
            original codes, and aid evolution.

            DNA is about a billion
            times smaller...

            ...than we see it here.

            Each of those things that looks
            like a piece of fruit is an atom.

            Without the tools of science...

            ...the machinery of life
            would be invisible.

            Four billion years ago...

            ...the ancestors of DNA competed
            for molecular building blocks...

            ...and left crude copies
            of themselves.

            There were no predators;
            the stuff of life was everywhere.

            The oceans and murky pools
            that filled the craters...

            ...were, for these molecules,
            a Garden of Eden.

            With reproduction, mutation
            and natural selection...

            ...the evolution of living
            molecules was well underway.

            Varieties with specialized
            functions joined together...

            ...making a collective.
            The first cell.

            The organic soup eventually
            ate itself up.

            But by this time, plants had evolved,
            able to use sunlight...

            ...to make their own building blocks.
            They turned the waters green.

            One-celled plants
            joined together:

            The first multi-cellular organisms.

            Equally important was the invention,
            not made until early November...

            ...of sex. It was stumbled upon
            by the microbes.

            By December 1, green plants
            had released copious amounts...

            ...of oxygen and nitrogen
            into the atmosphere.

            The sky is made by life.

            Then, suddenly, on December 1 5...

            ...there was an enormous proliferation
            of new life forms...

            ...an event called
            the "Cambrian Explosion."

            We know from fossils that life arose
            shortly after the Earth formed...

            ...suggesting that the origin
            of life might be...

            ...an inevitable chemical process
            on countless Earth-like planets...

            ...throughout the cosmos.

            But on the Earth, in nearly 4 billion
            years, life advanced no further...

            ...than algae.

            So maybe more complex forms of life
            are harder to evolve...

            ...harder even than the origin
            of life itself.

            If this is right, the planets
            of the galaxy...

            ...might be filled
            with microorganisms...

            ...but big beasts and vegetables
            and thinking beings...

            ...might be comparatively rare.

            By December 18, there were vast
            herds of trilobites...

            ...foraging on the ocean bottom...

            ...and squid-like creatures with
            multicolored shells...

            ...were everywhere.

            We know enough to sketch in a few
            of the subsequent details.

            The first fish and the first
            vertebrates appeared on December 19.

            Plants began to colonize the land
            on December 20.

            The first winged insects fluttered by
            on December 22.

            On this date also, there were
            the first amphibians...

            ...creatures something
            like the lungfish...

            ...able to survive both on land
            and in water.

            Our direct ancestors were now
            leaving the oceans behind.

            The first trees and the first reptiles
            evolved on December 23:

            Two amazing evolutionary developments.

            We are descended
            from some of those reptiles.

            The dinosaurs appeared
            on Christmas Eve.

            There were many different
            kinds of dinosaurs.

            The Earth was once their planet.

            Many stood upright and had
            some fair intelligence.

            Great lizards crashed and thundered
            through the steaming jungles.

            Unnoticed by the dinosaurs,
            a new creature...

            ...whose young were born live
            and helpless...

            ...was making its timid debut.

            The first mammals emerged
            on December 26...

            ...the first birds
            on the following day.

            But the dinosaurs still
            dominated the planet.

            Then suddenly, without warning,
            all over the planet at once...

            ...the dinosaurs died.

            The cause is unknown,
            but the lesson is clear:

            Even 160 million years on a planet
            is no guarantee of survival.

            The dinosaurs perished
            around the time of the first flower.

            On December 30, the first creatures...

            ...who looked even a little bit human,
            evolved...

            ...accompanied by a spectacular increase
            in the size of their brains.

            And then, on the evening
            of the last day of the last month...

            ...only a few million years ago...

            ...the first true humans took
            their place on the cosmic calendar.

            The written record of history...

            ...occupies only the last 10 seconds
            of the cosmic year.

            Now, let's take a closer look
            at who our ancestors were.

            A simple chemical circumstance
            led to a great moment...

            ...in the history of our planet.

            There were many molecules
            in the primordial soup.

            Some were attracted to water on one
            side and repelled by it on the other.

            This drove them together...

            ...into a tiny enclosed
            spherical shell...

            ...like a soap bubble,
            which protected the interior.

            Within the bubble,
            the ancestors of DNA found a home...

            ...and the first cell arose.

            It took hundreds of millions of years
            for tiny plants to evolve...

            ...giving off oxygen.

            But that branch didn't lead to us.

            Bacteria that could breathe oxygen
            took over a billion years to evolve.

            From a naked nucleus, a cell
            developed with a nucleus inside.

            Some of these amoeba-like forms
            led eventually to plants.

            Others produced colonies...

            ...with inside and outside cells
            performing different functions.

            Becoming...

            ...a polyp attached
            to the ocean floor...

            ...filtering food from the water...

            ...and evolving little tentacles...

            ...to direct food
            into a primitive mouth.

            This humble ancestor of ours
            also led...

            ...to spiny-skinned armored animals
            with internal organs...

            ...including our cousin, the starfish.

            But we don't come from starfish.

            About 550 million years ago...

            ...filter feeders
            evolved gill slits...

            ...which were more efficient
            at straining food particles.

            One evolutionary branch
            led to acorn worms.

            Another led to a creature which
            swam freely in the larval stage...

            ...but, as an adult, was still
            firmly anchored to the ocean floor.

            Some became living hollow tubes.

            But others retained the larval forms
            throughout the life cycle...

            ...and became free-swimming adults
            with something like a backbone.

            Our ancestors now...

            ...500 million years ago,
            were jawless filter-feeding fish...

            ...a little like lampreys.

            Gradually, those tiny fish...

            ...evolved eyes and jaws.

            Fish then began to eat one another...

            ...if you could swim fast,
            you survived.

            If you had jaws to eat with, you could
            use your gills to breathe in the water.

            This is the way modern fish arose.

            During the summer,
            swamps and lakes dried up.

            Some fish evolved a primitive lung
            to breathe air until the rains came.

            Their brains were getting bigger.

            If the rains didn't come, it was handy
            to be able to pull yourself...

            ...to the next swamp.

            That was a very important adaptation.

            The first amphibians evolved,
            still with a fish-like tail.

            Amphibians, like fish, laid their eggs
            in water where they were easily eaten.

            But then a splendid
            new invention came along:

            The hard-shelled egg, laid on land
            where there were as yet no predators.

            Reptiles and turtles
            go back to those days.

            Many of the reptiles hatched on land
            never returned to the waters.

            Some became the dinosaurs.

            One line of dinosaurs developed
            feathers, useful for short flights.

            Today, the only living descendants
            of the dinosaurs are the birds.

            The great dinosaurs evolved
            along another branch.

            Some were the largest flesh-eaters
            ever to walk the land.

            But 65 million years ago they all
            mysteriously perished.

            Meanwhile, the forerunners
            of the dinosaurs...

            ...were also evolving
            in a different direction.

            Small, scurrying creatures...

            ...with the young growing
            inside the mother's body.

            After the extinction of the dinosaurs,
            many different forms developed.

            The young were very immature at birth.

            In the marsupials,
            the wombat, for example...

            ...and in the mammals, the young had
            to be taught how to survive.

            The brain grew larger still.

            Something like a shrew was
            the ancestor of all the mammals.

            One line took to the trees,
            developing dexterity...

            ...stereo vision, larger brains...

            ...and a curiosity
            about their environment.

            Some became baboons,
            but that's not the line to us.

            Apes and humans have
            a recent common ancestor.

            Bone for bone, muscle for muscle,
            molecule for molecule.

            There are almost no important
            differences between apes and humans.

            Unlike the chimpanzee,
            our ancestors walked upright...

            ...freeing their hands
            to poke and fix and experiment.

            We got smarter. We began to talk.

            Many collateral branches
            of the human family...

            ...became extinct in
            the last few million years.

            We, with our brains and our hands,
            are the survivors.

            There's an unbroken thread that
            stretches from those first cells to us.

            Let's look at it again...

            ...compressing 4 billion years
            of human evolution into 40 seconds.

            Those are some of the things
            that molecules do...

            ...given 4 billion years of evolution.

            We sometimes represent evolution as
            the ever-branching ramifications...

            ...of some original trunk...

            ...each branch pruned and clipped
            by natural selection.

            Every plant and animal
            alive today...

            ...has a history as ancient
            and illustrious as ours.

            Humans stand on one branch.

            But now we affect
            the future of every branch...

            ...of this 4-billion-year-old tree.

            How lovely trees are.

            The human species grew up
            in and around them.

            We have a natural affinity for trees.

            Trees photosynthesize...

            ...they harvest sunlight...

            ...they compete for the sun's favors.

            Look at those two trees there...

            ...pushing and shoving for sunlight...

            ...but with grace
            and astonishing slowness.

            There are so many plants
            on the Earth...

            ...that there's a danger
            of thinking them trivial...

            ...of losing sight of the subtlety
            and efficiency of their design.

            They are great and beautiful
            machines, powered by sunlight...

            ...taking in water from the ground
            and carbon dioxide from the air...

            ...and converting them into food
            for their use and ours.

            This is a museum of living plants.

            The Royal Botanic Gardens
            at Kew in London.

            Every plant uses
            the carbohydrates it makes...

            ...as an energy source
            to go about its planty business.

            And we animals, who are ultimately
            parasites on the plants...

            ...we steal the carbohydrates
            so we can go about our business.

            In eating the plants
            and their fruits...

            ...we combine the carbohydrates
            with oxygen...

            ...which as a result of breathing,
            we've dissolved in our blood.

            From this chemical reaction, we
            extract the energy which makes us go.

            In the process,
            we exhale carbon dioxide...

            ...which the plants then use
            to make more carbohydrates.

            What a marvelous
            cooperative arrangement.

            Plants and animals each using
            the other's waste gases...

            ...the whole cycle powered
            by abundant sunlight.

            But there would be carbon dioxide in
            the air even if there were no animals.

            We need the plants
            much more than they need us.

            There are family resemblances
            among the organisms of the Earth.

            Some are very apparent,
            such as the use of the number five.

            Humans have five major
            bodily projections:

            One head, two arms, two legs.

            So do ducks...

            ...although the functions of their
            projections are not quite the same.

            An octopus or a centipede
            has a different plan.

            And a being from another planet
            might be much stranger still.

            These family resemblances continue
            and on a much deeper level...

            ...when we go to the
            molecular basis of life.

            There are tens of billions...

            ...of different kinds
            of organic molecules.

            Yet only about 50 of them...

            ...are used in the essential
            machinery of life.

            The same 50 employed
            over and over again...

            ...ingenious, for different functions
            in every living thing.

            And when we go to the very kernel
            of life on Earth...

            ...to the proteins that
            control cell chemistry...

            ...to the spiral or helix
            of nucleic acids...

            ...which carry
            the hereditary information...

            ...we find these molecules
            to be identical...

            ...in all plants and animals
            of our planet.

            This oak tree and me,
            we're made of the same stuff.

            If you go back, you'll find
            that we have a common ancestor.

            That's why our chemistry is so alike.

            Let's take a trip to examine
            this common basis of life.

            A voyage to investigate
            the molecular machinery...

            ...at the heart of life on Earth.

            A journey to the nucleus of the cell.

            First we need a cell.

            I have trillions.
            I can afford to donate a few.

            The casual act of pricking a finger...

            ...is an event of some magnitude
            on the scale of the very small.

            Millions of red blood cells are
            detoured from their usual routes.

            But most continue
            to cruise about the body...

            ...carrying their cargoes of oxygen
            to the remotest freckle.

            We're about to enter
            the living cell...

            ...a realm, in its own way,
            as complex and beautiful...

            ...as the realm of galaxies and stars.

            Among the red blood cells,
            we encounter a white blood cell...

            ...a lymphocyte...

            ...whose job it is to protect me
            against invading microbes.

            It makes antibodies
            on its furrowed surface...

            ...but its interior is
            like that of many cells.

            Plunging through the membrane,
            we find ourselves inside the cell.

            Here, every structure
            has its function.

            These dark green blobs
            are factories...

            ...where messenger molecules
            are busy building the enzymes...

            ...which control
            the chemistry of the cell.

            The messengers were
            instructed and dispatched...

            ...from within the nucleus,
            the heart and brain of the cell.

            All the instructions on
            how to get a cell to work...

            ...and how to make another
            are hidden away in there.

            We find a tunnel, a nuclear pore...

            ...an approach to
            the biological holy of holies.

            These necklaces, these intricately
            looped and coiled strands...

            ...are nucleic acids, DNA.

            Everything you need to know on
            how to make a human being...

            ...is encoded in the language
            of life in the DNA molecule.

            This is the DNA double helix...

            ...a machine with about 100 billion
            moving parts, called atoms.

            There are as many atoms
            in one molecule of DNA...

            ...as there are stars
            in a typical galaxy.

            The sequence of nucleotides,
            here brightly colored...

            ...is all that's passed on
            from generation to generation.

            Change the order of the nucleotides...

            ...and you change
            the genetic instructions.

            DNA must replicate itself
            with extreme fidelity.

            The reproduction of a DNA molecule
            begins by separating the two helices.

            This is accomplished
            by an unwinding enzyme.

            Like some precision tool,
            this enzyme, shown in blue...

            ...breaks the chemical bonds
            that bind the two helices of DNA.

            The enzyme works its way
            down the molecule...

            ...unzipping DNA as it goes.

            Each helix copies the other...

            ...supervised by special enzymes.

            The organic soup inside the nucleus
            contains many free nucleotides.

            The enzyme recognizes an approaching
            nucleotide and clicks it into place...

            ...reproducing another rung
            in the double helix.

            When the DNA is replicating
            in one of your cells...

            ...a few dozen nucleotides
            are added every second.

            Thousands of these enzymes may be
            working on a given DNA molecule.

            When an arriving nucleotide
            doesn't fit...

            ...the enzyme throws it away.

            We call this proofreading.

            On the rare occasions
            of a proofreading error...

            ...the wrong nucleotide is attached...

            ...and a small random change has
            been made in the genetic instructions.

            A mutation has occurred.

            This enzyme is a
            pretty small molecule...

            ...but it catches nucleotides,
            assembles them in the right order...

            ...it knows how to proofread...

            ...it's responsible
            in the most fundamental way...

            ...for the reproduction of every cell
            and every being on Earth.

            That enzyme and DNA itself...

            ...are molecular machines
            with awesome powers.

            Within every living thing,
            the molecular machines are busy...

            ...making sure that nucleic acids
            will continue to reproduce.

            A minor cut in my skin
            sounds a local alarm...

            ...and the blood spins
            a complex net of strong fibers...

            ...to form a clot
            and staunch the flow of blood.

            There's a very delicate balance here:

            Too much clotting
            and your blood stream will solidify.

            Too little clotting and you'll bleed
            to death from the merest scratch.

            The balance is controlled
            by enzymes instructed by DNA.

            Down here, there's also
            a kind of sanitation squad...

            ...comprised of white blood cells,
            that swings into action...

            ...surrounds invading bacteria
            and ravenously consumes them.

            This mopping-up operation is
            a part of the healing process...

            ...again controlled by DNA.

            These cells are parts of us,
            but how alien they seem.

            Within each of them,
            within every cell...

            ...there are exquisitely
            evolved molecular machines.

            Nucleic acids, enzymes,
            the cell architecture...

            ...every cell is a triumph
            of natural selection.

            And we're made of trillions of cells.

            We are, each of us, a multitude.

            Within us is a little universe.

            Human DNA is a coiled ladder...

            ...a billion nucleotides long.

            Many possible combinations of
            nucleotides are nonsense. That is...

            ...they translate into proteins which
            serve no useful function whatever.

            Only a comparatively few
            nucleic acid molecules...

            ...are any good for life forms
            as complicated as we are.

            But even so, the number of useful ways
            of assembling nucleic acids...

            ...is stupefyingly large.

            It's probably larger than the total
            number of atoms in the universe.

            This means that the number of
            possible kinds of human beings...

            ...is vastly greater than the number
            of human beings that has ever lived.

            This untapped potential of
            the human species is immense.

            There are ways of
            putting nucleic acids together...

            ...which will function far better
            by any criterion you wish to choose...

            ...than the hereditary instructions of
            any human being who has ever lived.

            Fortunately, we do not know,
            or at least do not yet know...

            ...how to assemble alternative
            sequences of nucleotides...

            ...to make alternative kinds
            of human beings.

            In the future, we might be able
            to put nucleotides together...

            ...in any desired sequence...

            ...to produce human characteristics
            we think desirable.

            A disquieting and awesome prospect.

            We human beings don't look
            very much like a tree.

            We certainly view the world
            differently than a tree does.

            But down deep,
            at the molecular heart of life...

            ...we're essentially
            identical to trees.

            We both use nucleic acids
            as the hereditary material.

            We both use proteins as enzymes
            to control the chemistry of the cell.

            And most significantly,
            we both use the identical code book...

            ...to translate nucleic acid information
            into protein information.

            Any tree could read my genetic code.

            How did such astonishing similarities
            come about?

            Why are we cousins to the trees?

            Would life on some other planet
            use proteins?

            The same proteins? The same nucleic
            acids? The same genetic code?

            The usual explanation
            is that we are...

            ...all of us, trees and people...

            ...anglerfish, slime molds,
            bacteria...

            ...all descended from a single
            and common instance...

            ...of the origin of life
            4 billion years ago...

            ...in the early days of our planet.

            Now, how...

            ...did the molecules
            of life arise?

            (THUNDER)

            (LIGHTNING BUZZES)

            In a laboratory
            at Cornell University...

            ...we mix together the gases
            and waters of the primitive Earth...

            ...supply some energy...

            ...and see if we can make
            the stuff of life.

            But what was the early atmosphere
            made of, ordinary air?

            If we start with
            our present atmosphere...

            ...the experiment is a dismal failure.

            Instead of making proteins
            and nucleic acids...

            ...all we make is smog,
            a backwards step.

            Why doesn't such an experiment work?

            Because the air of today
            contains molecular oxygen.

            But oxygen is made by plants.

            It's obvious that there were
            no plants before the origin of life.

            We mustn't use oxygen
            in our experiments...

            ...because there wasn't any
            in the early atmosphere.

            This is reasonable because the cosmos
            is made mostly of hydrogen...

            ...which gobbles oxygen up.

            The Earth's low gravity has
            allowed most of our hydrogen gas...

            ...to trickle away to space.
            There's almost none left.

            But 4 billion years ago...

            ...our atmosphere was full
            of hydrogen-rich gases:

            Methane, ammonia, water vapor.

            These are the gases we should use.

            Taking great care to ensure
            the purity of these gases...

            ...my colleague, Bishun Khare,
            pumps them from their holding flasks.

            An experiment like this
            was first performed...

            ...by Stanley Miller
            and Harold Urey in the 1950s.

            (GASES FIZZLE)

            The starting gases are now introduced
            into a large reaction vessel.

            We could shine ultraviolet light,
            simulating the early sun.

            But in this experiment...

            ...the gases will be sparked...

            ...as the primitive atmosphere was
            by early lightning.

            (LIGHTNING BUZZES)

            After only a few hours,
            the interior of the reaction vessel...

            ...becomes streaked with
            a strange brown pigment...

            ...a rich collection
            of complex organic molecules...

            ...including the building blocks of
            the proteins and the nucleic acids.

            Under the right conditions, these
            building blocks assemble themselves...

            ...into molecules resembling little
            proteins and little nucleic acids.

            These nucleic acids can even make
            identical copies of themselves.

            In this vessel are the notes
            of the music of life...

            ...although not yet the music itself.

            Now, no one, so far...

            ...has mixed together the gases
            and waters of the primitive Earth...

            ...and at the end of the experiment
            had something crawl out of the flask.

            There's still much to be understood
            about the origin of life...

            ...including the origin
            of the genetic code.

            But we've only been at
            such experiments for 30 years.

            Nature's had
            a 4-billion-year head start.

            Incidentally, there's nothing in such
            experiments that's unique to the Earth.

            The gases we start with,
            the energy sources we use...

            ...are entirely common
            through the cosmos.

            So chemical reactions something like
            these must be responsible for...

            ...the organic matter
            in interstellar space...

            ...and the amino acids
            in the meteorites.

            Similar chemical reactions
            must have occurred...

            ...on a billion other worlds
            in the Milky Way galaxy.

            Look how easy it is to make
            great globs of this stuff.

            The molecules of life fill the cosmos.

            Now...

            What would life elsewhere look like?

            Even if it had an identical molecular
            chemistry to life on Earth...

            ...which I very much doubt...

            ...it could not be
            very similar in form...

            ...to familiar organisms on the Earth.

            The random character of
            the evolutionary process...

            ...must create elsewhere creatures
            very different from any that we know.

            Think of a world
            something like Jupiter...

            ...with an atmosphere rich in hydrogen,
            helium, methane, water and ammonia...

            ...in which organic molecules
            might be...

            ...falling from the skies
            like manna from heaven...

            ...like the products of
            the Miller-Urey experiment.

            Could there be life on such a world?

            There's a special problem.
            The atmosphere is turbulent...

            ...and down deep, before we ever
            come to a surface, it's very hot.

            If you're not careful,
            you'll be carried down and fried.

            If you reproduce
            before you're fried...

            ...turbulence will carry your offspring
            into the higher and cooler layers.

            Such organisms could be very little.
            We call them sinkers.

            The physicist E.E. Salpeter and I
            at Cornell...

            ...have calculated
            something about the life...

            ...that might exist on such a world.

            Vast living balloons could
            stay buoyant...

            ...by pumping heavy gases
            from their interiors...

            ...or by keeping their insides warm.

            They might eat the organic molecules
            in the air...

            ...or make their own with sunlight.

            We call these creatures floaters.

            We imagine floaters
            kilometers across...

            ...enormously larger than
            the greatest whale that ever was...

            ...beings the size of cities.

            We conceive of them arrayed
            in great, lazy herds...

            ...as far as the eye can see...

            ...concentrated in the updrafts
            in the enormous sea of clouds.

            But there can be other creatures
            in this alien environment: hunters.

            Hunters are fast and maneuverable.

            They eat the floaters,
            both for their organic molecules...

            ...and for their store
            of pure hydrogen.

            But there can't be many hunters...

            ...because if they destroy all the
            floaters, they themselves will perish.

            Physics and chemistry permit
            such life forms.

            Art presents them with
            a certain reality...

            ...but nature is not obliged
            to follow our speculations.

            If there are billions of inhabited
            worlds in the Milky Way galaxy...

            ...then I think it's likely there are
            a few places which might have...

            ...hunters...

            ...and floaters and sinkers.

            Biology is more like history
            than it is like physics.

            You have to know the past
            to understand the present.

            There is no predictive theory of
            biology, nor is there for history.

            The reason is the same:

            Both subjects are still
            too complicated for us.

            But we can understand ourselves
            much better...

            ...by understanding other cases.

            The study of a single instance
            of extraterrestrial life...

            No matter how humble,
            a microbe would be just fine.

            ...will de-provincialize biology.

            It will show us what else is possible.

            We've heard so far the voice
            of life on only a single world...

            ...but for the first time,
            as we shall see...

            ...we've begun
            a serious scientific search...

            ...for the cosmic fugue.

            Recently, we've learned more
            about the origin of life.

            Do you remember RNA...

            ...that nucleic acid
            that our cells use as messengers...

            ...carrying the genetic information
            out of the cell nucleus?

            Well, it's been found that RNA,
            like protein...

            ...can control chemical reactions...

            ...as well as reproduce itself,
            which proteins can't do.

            Many scientists now wonder
            if the first life on Earth...

            ...was an RNA molecule.

            It now seems feasible that
            key molecular building blocks...

            ...for the origin of life, fell out
            of the skies 4 billion years ago.

            Comets have been found to have a lot
            of organic molecules in them...

            ...and they fell in huge numbers
            on the primitive Earth.

            We also mention the extinction
            of the dinosaurs...

            ...and most of the other species on
            Earth about 65 million years ago.

            We now know that a large comet
            hit the Earth at just that time.

            The dust pall from that collision
            must've cooled and darkened the Earth...

            ...perhaps killing all
            the dinosaurs, but sparing...

            ...the small, furry mammals
            who were our ancestors.

            Other cometary mass extinctions
            in other epochs seem likely.

            If true, this would mean that
            comets have been the bringers...

            ...both of life and death.

            SAGAN:
            There are two ways to view the stars:

            As they really are
            and as we might wish them to be.

            There are the Pleiades...

            ...a group of young stars
            astronomers recognize...

            ...as leaving their stellar nurseries
            of gas and dust.

            And this is the Crab Nebula...

            ...a stellar graveyard,
            where gas and dust...

            ...are being dispersed back
            into the interstellar medium.

            Inside it is a dying pulsar.

            Both the Pleiades
            and the Crab Nebula...

            ...are in a constellation
            astrologers long ago named...



            ...Taurus the Bull.

            They imagined it
            to influence our daily lives.

            Astronomers say that
            the planet Saturn...

            ...is an immense globe
            of hydrogen and helium...

            ...encircled by a ring of snowballs...

            ...50,000 kilometers wide...

            ...and that Jupiter's great red spot
            is a giant storm raging...

            ...for perhaps a million years.

            But the astrologers see the planets
            as affecting human character and fate.

            Jupiter represents a regal bearing
            and a gentle disposition.

            And Saturn, the gravedigger...

            ...fosters, they say, mistrust,
            suspicion, and evil.

            To the astronomers, Mars is
            a place as real as the Earth...

            ...a world awaiting exploration.



            But the astrologers see
            Mars as a warrior...

            ...the instigator of quarrels,
            violence and destruction.

            Astronomy and astrology
            were not always so distinct.

            For most of human history,
            the one encompassed the other.

            But there came a time...

            ...when astronomy escaped
            from the confines of astrology.

            The two traditions began to diverge...

            ...in the life and mind
            of Johannes Kepler.

            It was he who demystified
            the heavens by discovering...

            ...that a physical force lay behind
            the motions of the planets.

            He was the first astrophysicist
            and the last scientific astrologer.

            The intellectual foundations
            of astrology...

            ...were swept away 300 years ago...

            ...and yet, astrology is still taken
            seriously by a great many people.

            Have you ever noticed how easy it is
            to find a magazine on astrology?

            Virtually every newspaper in America
            has a daily column on astrology.

            Almost none of them have even
            a weekly column on astronomy.

            People wear astrological pendants...

            ...check their horoscopes
            in the morning...

            ...even our language preserves
            an astrological aspect.

            For example, take the word "disaster".

            It comes from the Greek
            for "bad star".

            Italians once believed disease was
            caused by the influence of the stars.

            It's the origin
            of our word "influenza."

            The zodiacal signs used
            by astrologers...

            ...even ornament this statue
            of Prometheus in New York City.

            Prometheus, who stole fire
            from the gods.

            What is all this astrology business?

            Fundamentally,
            it's the contention that...

            ...the constellations of the planets
            at the moment of your birth...

            ...profoundly influences your future.

            A few thousand years ago...

            ...the idea developed that
            the motions of the planets...

            ...determined the fates of kings...

            ...dynasties, empires.

            Astrologers studied the motions
            of the planets and asked...

            ...what had happened
            last time that, say...

            ...Venus was rising in
            the constellation of the Goat?

            Maybe something similar
            would happen this time.

            It was a subtle and risky business.

            Astrologers became employed
            only by the state.

            In many countries
            it became a capital offense...

            ...for anyone but official astrologers
            to read the portents in the skies.

            Why?

            Because a good way to overthrow
            a regime was to predict its downfall.

            Chinese court astrologers
            who made inaccurate predictions...

            ...were executed.

            Others simply doctored the records...

            ...so that afterwards they were
            in perfect conformity with events.

            Astrology developed
            into a strange discipline:

            A mixture of careful observations,
            mathematics and record-keeping...

            ...with fuzzy thinking
            and pious fraud.

            Nevertheless, astrology survived...

            ...and flourished. Why?

            Because it seems to lend...

            ...a cosmic significance
            to our daily lives.

            It pretends to satisfy our longing...

            ...to feel personally connected
            with the universe.

            Astrology suggests
            a dangerous fatalism.

            If our lives are controlled by a set
            of traffic signals in the sky...

            ...why try to change anything?

            Here, look at this.

            Two different newspapers, published
            in the same city on the same day.

            Let's see what they do
            about astrology.

            Suppose you were a Libra...

            ...that is born between
            September 23 and October 22.

            According to the astrologer
            for the New York Post:

            "Compromise will help ease tension."

            Well. maybe. It's sort of vague.

            According to the
            New York Daily News' astrologer:

            "Demand more of yourself."
            Well, also vague.

            But also pretty different.

            It's interesting that these
            predictions are not predictions.

            They tell you what to do,
            they don't say what will happen.

            They're consciously designed
            to be so vague...

            ...that it could apply to anybody...

            ...and they disagree with each other.

            Astrology can be tested
            by the lives of twins.

            There are many real cases like this:

            One twin is killed in childhood...

            ...in, say, a riding accident,
            or is struck by lightning...

            ...but the other lives
            to a prosperous old age.

            Suppose that happened to me.

            My twin and I would be born...

            ...in precisely the same place
            and within minutes of each other.

            Exactly the same planets would
            be rising at our births.

            If astrology were valid...

            ...how could we have such
            profoundly different fates?

            It turns out that astrologers
            can't even agree among themselves...

            ...what a given horoscope means.

            In careful tests
            they're unable to predict...

            ...the character and future of people
            they know nothing about...

            ...except the time and place of birth.

            Also, how could it possibly work?

            How could the rising of Mars at
            the moment of my birth affect me...

            ...then or now?

            I was born in a closed room.
            Light from Mars couldn't get in.

            The only influence of Mars which
            could affect me was its gravity.

            But the gravitational influence
            of the obstetrician...

            ...was much larger than
            the gravitational influence of Mars.

            Mars is a lot more massive...

            ...but the obstetrician
            was a lot closer.

            The desire to be connected
            with the cosmos...

            ...reflects a profound reality...

            ...for we are connected.

            Not in the trivial ways that the
            pseudo-science of astrology promises...

            ...but in the deepest ways.

            Our little planet is
            under the influence of a star.

            The sun warms us. It drives the weather.
            (We now know that not all life depends on sunlight.)

            It sustains all living things.
            (Life may even have begun in the sunless depths.)

            Four billion years ago,
            it brought forth life on Earth.

            But our sun...

            ...is only one of
            a billion trillion stars...

            ...within the observable universe.

            And those countless suns
            all obey natural laws...

            ...some of which are
            already known to us.

            How did we discover
            that there are such laws?

            If we lived on a planet
            where nothing ever changed...

            ...there wouldn't be much to do.

            There'd be nothing to figure out.

            There'd be no impetus for science.

            And if we lived in
            an unpredictable world...

            ...where things changed
            in random or complex ways...

            ...we wouldn't be able
            to figure things out.

            And again, there'd be
            no such thing as science.

            But we live in
            an in-between universe...

            ...where things change, all right...

            ...but according to patterns, rules...

            ...or as we call them,
            laws of nature.

            If I throw a stick up in the air...

            ...it always falls down.

            If the sun sets in the west...

            ...it always rises again
            the next morning in the east.

            And so, it's possible
            to figure things out.

            We can do science, and with it
            we can improve our lives.

            Human beings are good
            at understanding the world.

            We always have been.

            We were able to hunt game
            or build fires...

            ...only because we had
            figured something out.

            There once was a time...

            ...before television...

            ...before motion pictures,
            before radio, before books.

            The greatest part of human existence
            was spent in such a time.

            And then over the dying embers
            of the campfire...

            ...on a moonless night...

            ...we watched the stars.

            The night sky is interesting.
            There are patterns there.

            If you look closely,
            you can see pictures.

            One of the easiest constellations
            to recognize...

            ...lies in the northern skies.

            In North America,
            it's called the Big Dipper.

            The French have a similar idea.
            They call it La Casserole.

            "The casserole."

            In medieval England,
            the same pattern of stars...

            ...reminded people of
            a simple wooden plow.

            The ancient Chinese had
            a more sophisticated notion.

            To them these stars carried...

            ...the celestial bureaucrat on
            his rounds about the sky...

            ...seated on the clouds
            and accompanied...

            ...by his eternally
            hopeful petitioners.

            The people of northern Europe
            imagined another pattern.

            To them it was
            Charles' Wain, or wagon.

            A medieval cart.

            But other cultures saw these seven
            stars as part of a larger picture.

            It was the tail of a great bear...

            ...which the ancient Greeks
            and Native Americans saw...

            ...instead of the handle of a dipper.

            But the most imaginative interpretation
            of this larger group of stars...

            ...was that of the ancient Egyptians.

            They made out a curious procession
            of a bull and a reclining man...

            ...followed by a strolling hippopotamus
            with a crocodile on its back.

            What a marvelous diversity
            in the images various cultures saw...

            ...in this particular constellation.

            But the same is true
            for all the other constellations.

            Some people think these things
            are really in the night sky...

            ...but we put these pictures
            there ourselves.

            We were hunter folk...

            ...so we put hunters and dogs...

            ...lions and young women
            up in the skies.

            All manner of things
            of interest to us.

            When 17th century European sailors
            first saw the southern skies...

            ...they put all sorts of things
            of 17th century interest up there.

            Microscopes and telescopes,
            compasses...

            ...and the sterns of ships.

            If the constellations had been
            named in the 20th century...

            ...I suppose we'd put there
            refrigerators and bicycles...

            ...rock stars,
            maybe even mushroom clouds.

            A new set of human hopes and fears...

            ...placed among the stars.

            But there's more to the stars
            than just pictures.

            For example, stars always
            rise in the east...

            ...and always set in the west...

            ...taking the whole night to cross
            the sky if they pass overhead.

            There are different constellations
            in different seasons.

            The same constellations always rise
            at, say, the beginning of autumn.

            It never happens that
            a new constellation...

            ...suddenly appears out of the east,
            one that you never saw before.

            There's a regularity, a permanence...

            ...a predictability about the stars.

            In a way, they're almost comforting.

            The return of the sun
            after a total eclipse...

            ...its rising in the morning after
            its troublesome absence at night...

            ...and the reappearance of the
            crescent moon after the new moon...

            ...all spoke to our ancestors...

            ...of the possibility
            of surviving death.

            Up there in the skies
            was a metaphor of immortality.

            Almost a thousand years ago
            in the American Southwest...

            ...the Anasazi people
            built a stone temple...

            ...an astronomical observatory
            to mark the longest day of the year.

            Dawn on that day must
            have been a joyous occasion...

            ...a celebration of
            the generosity of the sun.

            They built this ceremonial calendar...

            ...so that the sun's rays
            would penetrate a window...

            ...and enter a particular niche...

            ...on this day alone.

            That kind of precision is
            a triumph of human intelligence.

            It outlives its creators.

            Today, this is a lonely place.
            The Anasazi people are no more.

            They had learned to predict
            the changing of the seasons.

            They could not predict
            the changing of the climate...

            ...and the failure of the rains.

            But their temple continues to catch...

            ...the sun's first rays
            on the summer solstice.

            I imagine the Anasazi people...

            ...gathered in these pews
            every June 21 ...

            ...dressed with feathers
            and turquoise...

            ...to celebrate the power of the sun.

            These upper niches...

            ...there are 28 of them...

            ...may represent the number of days
            for the moon to reappear...

            ...in the same constellation.

            These people paid a lot
            of attention to the sun...

            ...and the moon and the stars.

            And other devices based
            on somewhat similar designs...

            ...can be found in Angkor Wat
            in Cambodia...

            ...Stonehenge in England...

            ...Abu Simbel in Egypt...

            ...Chich?n Itz? in Mexico...

            ...and in the Great Plains
            of North America.

            Now, why did people
            all over the world...

            ...go to such great trouble
            to teach themselves astronomy?

            It was literally
            a matter of life and death...

            ...to be able to predict the seasons.

            We hunted antelope or buffalo...

            ...whose migrations
            ebbed and flowed...

            ...with the seasons.

            Fruits and nuts were
            ready to be picked...

            ...in some times and not in others.

            When we invented agriculture,
            we had to take care...

            ...and sow our seeds and harvest
            our crops at just the right season.

            Annual meetings of
            far-flung nomadic peoples...

            ...were set for prescribed times.

            Now...

            Some alleged calendrical devices
            might be due to chance.

            For example...

            ...the accidental alignment
            of a window and a niche...

            ...but there are other devices,
            wonderfully different.

            Today, only the dry ruins
            of the great Anasazi cities...

            ...have survived the ravages of time.

            Not far from these ancient cities
            in an almost inaccessible location...

            ...there is another solstice marker.

            This one of singular
            and unmistakable purpose.

            The deliberate arrangement
            of three great stone slabs...

            ...allows a sliver of sunlight...

            ...to pierce the heart
            of a carved spiral...

            ...only at noon on
            the longest day of the year.

            (WIND WHISTLES)

            The wind whips through the canyons
            here in the American Southwest...

            ...and there's no one
            to hear it but us.

            A reminder of
            the 40,000 generations...

            ...of thinking men and women
            who preceded us...

            ...about whom we know
            next to nothing...

            ...upon whom our society is based.

            When our prehistoric ancestors
            studied the sky after sunset...

            ...they observed that some
            of the stars were not fixed...

            ...with respect to the constant
            pattern of the constellations.

            Instead, five of them moved...

            ...slowly forward across the sky...

            ...then backward for a few months,
            then forward again...

            ...as if they couldn't
            make up their minds.

            We call them planets...

            ...the Greek word for "wanderers".

            These planets presented
            a profound mystery.

            The earliest explanation was
            that they were living beings.

            How else explain
            their strange, looping behavior?

            Later, they were thought to be gods...

            ...and then disembodied
            astrological influences.

            But the real solution
            to this particular mystery...

            ...is that planets are worlds,
            that the Earth is one of them...

            ...and that they go around the sun
            according to precise mathematical laws.

            This discovery has led directly...

            ...to our modern global civilization.

            The merging of imagination
            with observation...

            ...produced an exact description
            of the solar system.

            Only then could you answer
            the fundamental question...

            ...at the root of modern science:

            What makes it all go?

            Two thousand years ago, no such
            question would have been asked.

            The prevailing view had then been
            formulated by Claudius Ptolemy...

            ...an Alexandrian astronomer...

            ...and also the preeminent
            astrologer of his time.

            Ptolemy believed that the Earth
            was the center of the universe...

            ...that the sun and the moon
            and the planets like Mars...

            ...went around the Earth.

            It's the most natural idea
            in the world.

            The earth seems steady,
            solid, immobile...

            ...while we can see the heavenly bodies
            rising and setting every day.

            But then, how explain
            the loop-the-loop motion...

            ...of the planets in the sky?
            Mars, for example?

            This little machine shows
            Ptolemy's model.

            The planets were imagined
            to go around the Earth...

            ...attached to
            perfect crystal spheres...

            ...but not attached directly
            to the spheres...

            ...but indirectly through
            a kind of off-center wheel.

            The sphere turns,
            the little wheel rotates...

            ...and as seen from the Earth,
            Mars does its loop-the-loop.

            This model permitted
            reasonably accurate predictions...

            ...of planetary motion.

            Good enough predictions
            for the precision of measurement...

            ...in Ptolemy's time and much later.

            Supported by the church
            through the Dark Ages...

            ...Ptolemy's model
            effectively prevented...

            ...the advance of astronomy
            for 1500 years.

            Finally, in 1543,
            a quite different explanation...

            ...of the apparent motion
            of the planets...

            ...was published by a Polish cleric
            named Nicolaus Copernicus.

            Its most daring feature
            was the proposition...

            ...that the sun was
            the center of the universe.

            The Earth was demoted
            to just one of the planets.

            The retrograde,
            or loop-the-loop motion...

            ...happens as the Earth
            overtakes Mars in its orbit.

            You can see that,
            from the standpoint of the Earth...

            ...Mars is now going
            slightly backwards...

            ...and now it is going
            in its original direction.

            This Copernican model worked
            at least as well...

            ...as Ptolemy's crystal spheres.

            But it annoyed an awful lot of people.

            The Catholic Church later
            put Copernicus' work...

            ...on its list of forbidden books.

            And Martin Luther described
            Copernicus in these words:

            "People give ear
            to an upstart astrologer.

            This fool wishes to reverse...

            ...the entire science of astronomy."

            Close quote.

            The confrontation between
            the two views of the cosmos...

            ...Earth-centered and sun-centered...

            ...reached its climax with a man...

            ...who, like Ptolemy, was both
            an astronomer and an astrologer.

            He lived in a time...

            ...when the human spirit
            was fettered...

            ...and the mind chained...

            ...when angels and demons
            and crystal spheres...

            ...were imagined up there
            in the skies.

            Science still lacked
            the slightest notion...

            ...of physical laws underlying nature.

            But the brave and lonely
            struggle of this man...

            ...was to provide the spark...

            ...that ignited the modern
            scientific revolution.

            Johannes Kepler was born
            in Germany in 1571.

            He was sent to the Protestant
            seminary school in Maulbronn...

            ...to be educated for the clergy.

            (BELL RINGS)

            It was a strict, disciplined life.

            Up before dawn to begin
            a long day of prayer and study.

            This was the age of the Reformation.

            Maulbronn was a kind of educational
            and ideological boot camp...

            ...training young Protestants
            in theological weaponry...

            ...against the fortress
            of Roman Catholicism.

            (SPEAKS IN GERMAN)

            There was little reassurance
            or comfort here...

            ...for a sensitive boy like Kepler.

            He was intelligent and he knew it.

            That, together with his stubbornness
            and his fierce independence...

            ...served to isolate him
            from the other boys.

            Kepler made few friends
            in his two years at Maulbronn.

            Amen.

            So he kept to himself, withdrawn
            into the world of his own thoughts...

            ...which were often concerned...

            ...with his imagined unworthiness
            in the eyes of God.

            He despaired of ever
            attaining salvation.

            (SPEAKS IN GERMAN)

            But God to him
            was more than punishment.

            God was also the creative power
            of the universe.

            And the young Kepler's
            curiosity about God...

            ...was even greater than his fear.

            He wanted to know
            God's plan for the world.

            He wanted to read the mind of God.

            This was his obsession.

            It was to inspire
            all his great achievements.

            It was to take him, and Europe...

            ...out of the cloister
            of medieval thought.

            In places like Maulbronn, the faint
            echoes of the genius of antiquity...

            ...still reverberated.

            Here, in addition to theology...

            ...Kepler was exposed to Greek
            and Latin, music and mathematics.

            And it was in geometry
            that he thought he glimpsed...

            ...the image of perfection.

            He was later to write:

            "Geometry existed
            before the Creation.

            It is coeternal with the mind of God.

            Geometry provided God...

            ...with a model for the Creation.

            Geometry...

            ...is God himself."

            But the real world of Kepler's time
            was far from perfect.

            It was haunted by fear,
            pestilence, famine and war.

            Superstition was a natural refuge
            for people who were powerless.

            Only one thing seemed certain:
            the stars themselves.

            It was remembered that in ancient
            times, the astrologer, Ptolemy...

            ...and the sage, Pythagoras,
            had taught...

            ...that the heavens were
            harmonious and changeless.

            Ptolemy had said that the motions
            of the planets through the stars...

            ...were portents
            of events here below.

            Was it the influence of Mars and Venus
            that made his father a brutal man...

            ...a mercenary who had abandoned him?

            (CHILDREN LAUGHING)

            Did an unfortunate conjunction
            of planets in an adverse sign...

            ...make his mother a mischievous
            and quarrelsome woman?

            If such things were fated
            by the stars...

            ...then perhaps there were
            hidden patterns...

            ...underlying the unpredictable
            chaos of daily life.

            Patterns as constant as the stars.

            But how could you discover them?
            Where would you begin?

            If the world and everything in it
            was crafted by God...

            ...then shouldn't you begin with
            a careful study of physical reality?

            Was not all of creation
            an expression...

            ...of the harmonies
            in the mind of God?

            The book of nature had waited
            1,500 years for a reader.

            In 1589, Kepler left Maulbronn...

            ...to continue his studies
            at the great university in T?bingen.

            It was a liberation
            to find himself...

            ...amidst the most vital
            intellectual currents of the time.

            One of his teachers
            revealed to him...

            ...the revolutionary ideas
            of Copernicus.

            Kepler relished...

            ...this urbane scholarly community.

            Here, his genius
            was recognized at last.

            Kepler was not to be ordained
            after T?bingen.

            Instead, to his surprise, he found
            himself summoned to Graz in Austria...

            ...to become a teacher
            of high school mathematics.

            Kepler was not a very good teacher.

            The first year in Graz, his class
            had only a handful of students.

            The second year, none.

            He mumbled. He digressed.

            He was, at times,
            utterly incomprehensible.

            He was distracted
            by an incessant clamor...

            ...of speculations and associations
            that ran through his head.

            (MUMBLES)

            One pleasant summer afternoon...

            ...with his students longing
            for the end of the lecture...

            ...he was visited by a revelation
            that was to alter radically...

            ...the future course
            of astronomy and the world.

            (TOP CLUNKS)

            There were only six planets
            known in his time:

            Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
            Jupiter and Saturn.

            For some time,
            Kepler had been wondering:

            Why only six planets?

            Why not 20 planets, or 100?

            And why this particular spacing
            between their orbits?

            No one had ever asked
            such questions before.

            In the course of
            a lecture on astrology...

            ...Kepler inscribed within
            the circle of the zodiac...

            ...a triangle with three equal sides.

            He then noticed, quite by accident...

            ...that a smaller circle
            inscribed within the triangle...

            ...bore the same relationship
            to the outer circle...

            ...as did the orbit of Jupiter
            to the orbit of Saturn.

            Could a similar geometry relate
            the orbits of the other planets?

            Now Kepler remembered
            the perfect solids of Pythagoras.

            Of all the possible
            three-dimensional shapes...

            ...there were only five
            whose sides were regular polygons.

            He believed that
            the two numbers were connected...

            ...that the reason
            there were only six planets...

            ...was that there were
            only five regular solids.

            In these perfect solids,
            nested one within the other...

            ...he believed he had discovered
            the invisible supports...

            ...for the spheres of the six planets.

            This connection
            between geometry and astronomy...

            ...could admit only one explanation:

            The hand of God, mathematician.

            "The intense pleasure I received
            from this discovery...

            ...can never be told in words,"
            he said.

            "Now I no longer became weary at work.

            Days and nights
            I passed in mathematical labors...

            ...until I could see if my hypothesis
            would agree with Copernicus'...

            ...or if my joy would vanish
            into thin air."

            But no matter how he hard tried, the
            perfect solids and planetary orbits...

            ...did not agree
            with each other very well.

            Why didn't it work?

            Because, unfortunately, it was wrong.

            The true orbital sizes
            of the planets we now know...

            ...have absolutely nothing to do
            with the five perfect solids...

            ...as the later discovery
            of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto shows.

            But Kepler spent
            the rest of his life...

            ...pursuing this
            geometrical phantasm.

            He couldn't abandon it,
            and he couldn't make it work.

            His frustration
            must have been enormous.

            Finally he decided that...

            ...the accepted planetary
            observations were inaccurate...

            ...and not his model
            of the nested solids.

            Only one man had access
            to more precise observations.

            That man was Tycho Brahe...

            ...who, coincidentally, had recently
            written Kepler to come and join him.

            Kepler was reluctant at first,
            but he had no choice.

            In 1598, a wave of oppression
            enveloped Graz.

            It was spearheaded
            by the local archduke...

            ...who vowed to restore Catholicism
            to the province...

            ...and in his own words...

            ..."would rather make
            a desert of the country...

            ...than rule over heretics."

            Kepler's school was closed.

            People were forbidden to worship
            or to sing hymns...

            ...or to own books
            of a heretical nature.

            Those who refused Catholicism
            were fined 10% of their assets...

            ...and exiled from the country
            on pain of death.

            Kepler chose exile.

            "Hypocrisy, I have never learned.

            I am in earnest about faith.
            I do not play with it."

            For Kepler, it was only the first
            in a series of exiles...

            ...forced upon him
            by religious fanatics.

            Now he decided to accept
            Tycho Brahe's open invitation.

            Brahe, a wealthy Danish nobleman,
            lived in great splendor...

            ...and had recently been appointed
            Imperial Mathematician at Prague.

            Kepler left Graz
            with his wife and stepdaughter...

            ...and set out
            on the difficult journey.

            Kepler's wife was not a happy woman.

            She was chronically ill and
            had recently lost two young children.

            The marriage was no comfort.

            She had no understanding
            of his work...

            ...and regarded his profession
            with contempt.

            Kepler was married to his work...

            ...and every tedious mile
            was bringing him closer...

            ...to the great Tycho Brahe,
            whose observations...

            ...he devoutly hoped,
            would confirm his theory.

            Kepler envisioned Tycho's domain as
            a sanctuary from the evils of the time.

            He aspired to be a worthy colleague
            to the illustrious Tycho...

            ...who for 35 years
            had been immersed...

            ...in exact measurements
            of a clockwork universe...

            ...ordered and precise.

            (LAUGHING)

            But Tycho's court was not at all
            what Kepler had expected.

            TYCHO:
            Vinol

            Tycho himself was
            a flamboyant figure...

            ...adorned with a gold nose.

            The original was lost
            in a student duel...

            ...fought over who was
            the superior mathematician.

            And he maintained
            a circus-like entourage...

            ...of assistants, distant relatives...

            ...and assorted hangers-on.

            (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

            Kepler had no use
            for the endless revelry.

            He impatient to see Tycho's data.

            But Tycho would give him
            only a few scraps at a time.

            "Tycho," he said, "gave me no
            opportunity to share in his studies.

            He would only,
            in the course of a meal, mention...

            ...as if in passing...

            ...today, the figure
            of the apogee of one planet.

            Tomorrow, the nodes of another."

            Kepler was ill-suited
            for such games...

            ...and the general climate
            of intrigue...

            ...offended his sense of propriety.

            Their cruel mockery of
            the pious and scholarly Kepler...

            ...depressed and saddened him.

            "My opinion of Tycho is this:

            He is superlatively rich...

            ...but knows not how
            to make proper use of it."

            Tycho possesses the best observations,
            he also has collaborators.

            He lacks only the architect...

            ...who would put all this to use."

            (BAND PLAYS)

            Tycho was unable
            to turn his observations...

            ...into a coherent theory
            of the solar system.

            He knew he needed
            the brilliant Kepler's help.

            But simply to hand over
            his life's work to a potential rival?

            That was unthinkable.

            (KEPLER SHOUTS)

            Tycho was the greatest observational
            genius of the age...

            ...and Kepler
            the greatest theoretician.

            Either man alone could not
            achieve the synthesis...

            ...which both felt was now possible.

            TYCHO:
            Keplerel

            The birth of modern science...

            ...which is the fusion
            of observation and theory...

            ...teetered on the precipice
            of their mutual distrust.

            The two repeatedly quarreled...

            ...and were reconciled.

            Until, a few months later...

            ...Tycho died of
            his habitual overindulgence...

            ...in food and wine.

            Kepler wrote to a friend:

            "On the last night
            of Tycho's gentle delirium...

            ...he repeated over
            and over again these words...

            ...like someone composing a poem:

            'Let me not seem
            to have lived in vain.

            Let me not seem
            to have lived in vain.'

            And he did not."

            Eventually, after Tycho's death...

            ...Kepler contrived
            to extract the observations...

            ...from Tycho's reluctant family.

            Observations of the apparent motion...

            ...of Mars through
            the constellations...

            ...obtained over
            a period of many years.

            The data, from the last few decades...

            ...before the invention
            of the telescope...

            ...were by far the most precise
            ever obtained up to that time.

            Kepler worked with
            a kind of passionate intensity...

            ...to understand Tycho's observations.

            What real motions of the Earth...

            ...and Mars about the sun...

            ...could explain,
            to the precision of measurement...

            ...the apparent motion, as seen
            from the Earth, of Mars in the sky.

            And why Mars?

            Tycho had told Kepler that
            the apparent motion of Mars...

            ...was the most difficult
            to reconcile with a circular orbit.

            After years of calculation,
            he believed he'd found the values...

            ...for a Martian circular orbit
            which matched...

            ...ten of Tycho Brahe's observations
            within two minutes of arc.

            There are sixty minutes of arc
            in an angular degree...

            ...and of course,
            90 degrees from horizon...

            ...to zenith.

            So a few minutes of arc is
            a small quantity to measure...

            ...especially without a telescope.

            But Kepler's ecstasy of discovery...

            ...soon crumbled into gloom.

            Two further observations by Tycho
            were inconsistent with his orbit...

            ...by as much as eight minutes of arc.

            Kepler wrote, "If I had believed we
            could ignore these eight minutes...

            ...I would've patched up
            my hypothesis accordingly.

            Since it was not permissible
            to ignore them...

            ...those eight minutes
            pointed the road...

            ...to a complete reformation
            of astronomy."

            The difference between a circular orbit
            and the true orbit of Mars...

            ...could be distinguished
            only by precise measurement...

            ...and by a courageous
            acceptance of the facts.

            Kepler was profoundly annoyed
            at having to abandon a circular orbit.

            It shook his faith in God...

            ...as the Maker of
            a perfect celestial geometry.

            "Having cleaned the stable...

            ...of astronomy of circles
            and spirals," he said...

            ...he was left...

            ...with "only a single
            cartful of dung."

            He tried various oval-like curves,
            calculated away...

            ...made some arithmetical mistakes...

            ...which caused him
            to reject the correct answer.

            Months later, in some desperation...

            ...he tried the formula
            for the first time for an ellipse.

            The ellipse matched
            the observations of Tycho beautifully.

            In such an orbit,
            the sun isn't at the center.

            It is offset.
            It's at one focus of the ellipse.

            When a given planet is at the far
            point in its orbit from the sun...

            ...it goes more slowly.

            As it approaches the near point,
            it speeds up.

            Such motion is why
            we describe the planets...

            ...as forever falling
            towards the sun...

            ...but never reaching it.

            Kepler's first law of
            planetary motion is simply this:

            A planet moves in an ellipse...

            ...with the sun at one focus.

            As a planet moves along its orbit,
            it sweeps out...

            ...in a given period of time,
            an imaginary wedge-shaped area.

            When the planet's far from the sun,
            the area's long and thin.

            When the planet is close to the sun,
            the area is short and squat.

            Though the shapes of
            the wedges are different...

            ...Kepler found that
            their areas are exactly the same.

            This provided a precise description
            of how a planet changes its speed...

            ...in relation to its distance
            from the sun.

            Now, for the first time...

            ...astronomers could predict
            where a planet would be...

            ...in accordance with
            a simple and invariable law.

            Kepler's second law is this:

            A planet sweeps out equal areas
            in equal times.

            Kepler's first two
            laws of planetary motion...

            ...may seem a little
            remote and abstract.

            Planets move in ellipses and they
            sweep out equal areas in equal times.

            So what?

            It's not as easy to grasp
            as circular motion.

            We might have a tendency
            to dismiss it...

            ...to say it's a mere
            mathematical tinkering...

            ...something removed
            from everyday life.

            But these are the laws
            our planet itself obeys.

            As we, glued by gravity
            to the surface of the Earth...

            ...hurtle through space...

            ...we move in accord
            with laws of nature...

            ...which Kepler first discovered.

            When we send spacecraft
            to the planets...

            ...when we observe double stars...

            ...when we examine the motion
            of distant galaxies...

            ...we find that all over the universe,
            Kepler's laws are obeyed.

            Many years later...

            ...Kepler came upon his third
            and last law of planetary motion.

            A law which relates the motion of
            the various planets to each other...

            ...which lays out correctly...

            ...the clockwork of the solar system.

            He discovered
            a mathematical relationship...

            ...between the size
            of a planet's orbit...

            ...and the average speed at
            which it travels around the sun.

            This confirmed his long-held belief...

            ...that there must be a force in
            the sun that drives the planets.

            A force stronger for
            the inner, fast-moving planets...

            ...and weaker for
            the outer, slow-moving planets.

            Isaac Newton later identified
            that force as gravity.

            Answering at last
            the fundamental question:

            What makes the planets go?

            Kepler's third or Harmonic Law...

            ...states that the squares
            of the periods of the planets...

            ...the time for them
            to make one orbit...

            ...are proportional to the cubes,
            the third power...

            ...of their average distances
            from the sun.

            So the further away a planet is
            from the sun, the slower it moves...

            ...but according to
            a precise mathematical law.

            Kepler was the first person in
            the history of the human species...

            ...to understand correctly
            and quantitatively...

            ...how the planets move...

            ...how the solar system works.

            The man who sought harmony
            in the cosmos...

            ...was fated to live at a time
            of exceptional discord on Earth.

            Exactly eight days after
            Kepler's discovery of his third law...

            ...there occurred in Prague
            an incident...

            ...that unleashed
            the devastating Thirty Years' War.

            The war's convulsions shattered
            the lives of millions of people.

            Kepler lost his wife and young son
            to an epidemic spread by the soldiery.

            His royal patron was deposed...

            ...and he was excommunicated
            from the Lutheran church...

            ...for his uncompromising independence
            on questions of belief.

            He was a refugee once again.

            The conflict...

            ...portrayed on both sides
            as a "holy war"...

            ...was more an exploitation
            of religious bigotry...

            ...by those hungry for land and power.

            This war introduced
            organized pillage...

            ...to keep armies in the field.

            The brutalized population of Europe
            stood by helpless...

            ...as their plowshares
            and pruning hooks...

            ...were literally beaten
            into swords and spears.

            Rumor and paranoia swept
            through the countryside...

            ...enveloping especially
            the powerless.

            Among the many scapegoats chosen...

            ...were elderly women living alone,
            who were charged with witchcraft.

            (THUNDER)

            (HORSE WHINNIES)

            (WOMAN CRIES)

            Kepler's mother was taken away
            in the middle of the night...

            ...in a laundry chest.

            It took Kepler six years
            of unremitting effort...

            ...to save her life.

            In Kepler's little hometown,
            about three women were arrested...

            ...tortured and killed
            as witches every year...

            ...between 1615 and 1629.

            And Katarina Kepler was
            a cantankerous old woman.

            She engaged in disputes
            which annoyed the local nobility...

            ...and she sold drugs.

            Poor Kepler thought that
            he himself had contributed...

            ...inadvertently,
            to his mother's arrest.

            It came about
            because he had written...

            ...one of the first works
            of science fiction.

            It was intended to explain
            and popularize science...

            ...and was called The Somnium.

            "The Dream."

            He imagined a journey to the moon...

            ...with the space travelers
            standing on the lunar surface...

            ...looking up to see,
            rotating slowly above them...

            ...the lovely planet Earth.

            Part of the basis for the charge
            of witchcraft was that...

            ...in his dream, Kepler used his
            mother's spells to leave the Earth.

            But he really believed that one day...

            ...human beings would launch
            celestial ships...

            ...with sails adapted
            to the breezes of heaven...

            ...filled with explorers who,
            he said...

            ..."would not fear
            the vastness of space."

            He speculated on the mountains,
            valleys, craters...

            ...climate and possible
            inhabitants of the moon.

            Before Kepler...

            ...astronomy had little connection
            with physical reality.

            But with Kepler came the idea that...

            ...a physical force moves
            the planets in their orbits.

            He was the first
            to combine a bold imagination...

            ...with precise measurements...

            ...to step out into the cosmos.

            It changed everything.

            This fusion of facts with dreams...

            ...opened the way to the stars.

            As a boy...

            ...Kepler had been captured
            by a vision of cosmic splendor...

            ...a harmony of the worlds...

            ...which he sought so tirelessly
            all his life.

            Harmony in this world eluded him.

            His three laws of
            planetary motion represent...

            ...we now know...

            ...a real harmony of the worlds.

            But to Kepler, they were
            only incidental to his quest...

            ...for a cosmic system
            based on the perfect solids.

            A system which, it turns out,
            existed only in his mind.

            Yet, from his work...

            ...we have found that scientific laws
            pervade all of nature...

            ...that the same rules apply
            on Earth as in the skies...

            ...that we can find
            a resonance, a harmony...

            ...between the way we think
            and the way the world works.

            When he found that his long-cherished
            beliefs did not agree...

            ...with the most
            precise observations...

            ...he accepted
            the uncomfortable facts.

            He preferred the hard truth...

            ...to his dearest illusions.

            That is the heart of science.

            SAGAN: This is the age of
            planetary exploration...

            ...when our ships have begun
            to sail the heavens.

            In those heavens, there are
            some worlds much like hell.

            Our planet is, in comparison,
            much like a heaven.

            But the gates of heaven and hell...

            ...are adjacent and unmarked.

            The Earth is a lovely...

            ...and more or less placid place.

            Things change, but slowly.

            You can lead a full life and never
            encounter a natural catastrophe...

            ...more violent than a storm.



            And so we become complacent...

            ...relaxed...

            ...unconcerned.

            But in the history of the solar
            system and even in human history...

            ...there are clear records
            of extraordinary...

            ...and devastating catastrophes.

            We have now achieved
            the dubious distinction...

            ...of making our own
            major catastrophes...

            ...both intentional and inadvertent.

            On the landscapes of other planets...

            ...where past records
            are better preserved...

            ...there's abundant evidence
            of major catastrophes.

            It's all a matter of time scale.

            An event which is improbable
            in 100 years...



            ...may be inevitable
            in 100 million.

            But even on the Earth
            in this century...

            ...there have been
            bizarre natural events.

            In remote central Siberia...

            ...there was a time
            when the Tungus people...

            ...told strange tales
            of a giant fireball...

            ...that split the sky
            and shook the Earth.

            They told of a blast
            of searing wind...

            ...that knocked down
            people and forests.

            It happened, they said,
            on a summer's morning...

            ...in the year 1908.

            In the late 1920s...

            ...L.A. Kulik, a Soviet scientist...

            ...organized expeditions
            to try and solve the mystery.

            He built boats to penetrate
            this trackless land:

            Snowbound in winter...

            ...a swampy morass in summer.

            Eyewitnesses told of
            a ball of flame...

            ...larger than the sun...

            ...that had blazed across the sky
            20 years before.

            Kulik assumed a giant meteorite
            had struck the Earth.

            He expected to find an enormous
            impact crater...

            ...and rare meteorite fragments...

            ...chipped off some distant asteroid.

            However, at ground zero...

            ...Kulik found upright trees
            stripped of their branches...

            ...but not a trace of the meteorite
            or its impact crater.

            He was deeply puzzled.

            He thought there were meteorite
            fragments buried in the swampy ground.

            So he set about digging trenches
            and pumping out the water.

            But the expected meteoritic rock
            and iron was not found.

            Undaunted, Kulik went on
            to make a thorough survey...

            ...despite the swarms of insects
            and other hardships.

            Because he discovered something that,
            in his own words...

            ..."exceeded all tales of eyewitnesses
            and my wildest expectations."

            For more than 20 kilometers
            in every direction from ground zero...

            ...the trees were flattened radially
            outward like broken matchsticks.

            There must've been
            a powerful explosion...

            ...several kilometers
            above the ground.

            The pressure wave, spreading out
            at the speed of sound...

            ...was reconstructed from barometric
            records at weather stations...

            ...across Siberia, through Russia
            and on into Western Europe.

            Dust from the explosion reflected
            so much sunlight back to Earth...

            ...that people could
            read by it at night...

            ...in London, 10,000 kilometers away.

            This really remarkable occurrence...

            ...is called the Tunguska Event.

            But what was it?

            Well, perhaps, some scientists
            have suggested...

            ...it was a chunk of antimatter
            from space...

            ...annihilated on contact with
            the ordinary matter of the Earth...

            ...disappearing in a flash
            of gamma rays.

            But the radioactivity you'd expect
            from matter-antimatter annihilation...

            ...is to be found nowhere
            at the impact site.

            Or, perhaps, other scientists
            have suggested...

            ...it was a mini black hole
            from space...

            ...which impacted the Earth
            in Siberia...

            ...tunneled through
            the solid body of Earth...

            ...and plunged out the other side.

            But the records of atmospheric
            shock waves give not a hint...

            ...of something booming out of
            the North Atlantic later that day.

            Or maybe, other people have speculated,
            it was a spaceship...

            ...of some unimaginably advanced
            extraterrestrial civilization...

            ...in desperate mechanical trouble...

            ...crashing in a remote region
            of an obscure planet.

            Well, if so, it's pretty startling
            that at the impact site...

            ...there is not a piece,
            not the tiniest transistor...

            ...of a crashed spacecraft.

            More prosaically, perhaps it was
            a large meteorite...

            ...or a small asteroid
            which hit the Earth.

            But even here,
            there are no observable telltale...

            ...rocky or metallic fragments
            of the sort...

            ...that you'd expect
            from such an impact.

            The key point of the Tunguska Event...

            ...is that there was a tremendous
            explosion, a great shock wave...

            ...many trees burned,
            an enormous forest fire...

            ...and yet, no crater in the ground.

            There seems to be
            only one explanation...

            ...which is consistent
            with these facts.

            And that explanation is this:

            In 1908, a piece of a comet...

            ...hit the Earth.

            No one saw it approach.

            A small point of light
            lost in the glare of the morning sun.

            It had been drifting for centuries
            through the inner solar system...

            ...like an iceberg in the ocean
            of interplanetary space.

            But this time, by accident...

            ...there was a planet in the way.

            From the time and direction of
            its approach, what hit the Earth...

            ...seems to have been a fragment
            of a comet named Encke.

            Hurtling at more than
            100,000 kilometers an hour...

            ...it was a mountain of ice
            about the size of a football field...

            ...and weighing almost a million tons.

            There was no warning, until
            it plunged into the atmosphere.

            (COMET RUMBLES)

            If such an explosion happened today...

            ...it might be thought,
            in the panic of the moment...

            ...to be produced by a nuclear weapon.

            Such a cometary impact and fireball...

            ...simulates all the effects
            of a 15-megaton nuclear burst...

            ...including the mushroom cloud,
            with one exception:

            There would be no radiation.

            So could a rare but natural event...

            ...the impact of a comet with Earth...

            ...trigger a nuclear war?

            It's a strange scenario:
            A small comet hits the Earth...

            ...as millions have during
            Earth's history...

            ...and the response
            of our civilization...

            ...is promptly to self-destruct.

            Maybe it's unlikely,
            but it might be a good idea...

            ...to understand comets
            and collisions and catastrophes...

            ...a little bit better than we do.

            Now, a comet, at least as far as
            we understand them today...

            ...is made mostly of ice:

            Water ice, maybe some ammonia ice...

            ...a little bit of methane ice.

            So in striking
            the Earth's atmosphere...

            ...a modest cometary fragment...

            ...will produce a great radiant
            fireball and a mighty blast wave.

            It'll burn trees and level forests...

            ...and make a sound
            heard around the world.

            But it need not make
            a crater in the ground.

            Why? Because the ices in the comet
            are all melted in the impact.

            And there's going to be very
            few recognizable pieces of comet...

            ...left on the ground.

            We humans like to think of
            the heavens as stable...

            ...serene, unchanging.

            But comets suddenly appear...

            ...and hang ominously in the sky,
            night after night, for weeks.

            So the idea developed that the comet
            had to be there for a reason.

            The reason was that comets were
            predictions of disaster...

            ...that they foretold the deaths
            of princes and the fall of kingdoms.

            In 1066, for example...

            ...the Normans witnessed an apparition
            or appearance of Halley's comet.

            Since a comet must, they thought,
            predict the fall of some kingdom...

            ...they promptly invaded England.

            Here's King Harold of England
            looking a little glum.

            The events were noted
            in the Bayeux tapestry...

            ...a kind of newspaper of the day.

            Or, in the early 13th century...

            ...Giotto, one of the founders
            of modern realistic painting...

            ...witnessed another apparition
            of comet Halley...

            ...and inserted it into a nativity
            he was painting.

            A harbinger of a different
            sort of change of kingdoms.

            Around 1517...

            ...another great comet appeared.
            This time it was seen in Mexico.

            And the Aztec emperor, Moctezuma...

            ...maybe this is he...

            ...promptly executed his astrologers.

            Why? They hadn't predicted the comet,
            and they sure hadn't explained it.

            Moctezuma was positive that the comet
            foretold some dreadful disaster.

            He became distant and gloomy...

            ...and in that way,
            helped to set the stage...

            ...for the successful Spanish conquest
            of Mexico under Cort?s.

            In many cases, a superstitious
            belief in comets...

            ...becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

            Here are two quite different
            representations...

            ...of the great comet of 1577:

            This one pictured by the Turks...

            ...and this one by the Germans.

            In 1705, Edmund Halley finally...

            ...figured out that the same
            spectacular comet...

            ...was booming by the Earth
            every 76 years, like clockwork.

            That comet is now called,
            appropriately, comet Halley.

            And it's the same one that we talked
            about before, the comet of 1066.

            At that point, the subject began
            to lose a little...

            ...of its burden of superstition,
            but hardly all.

            Public fear of comets survived.
            Well, for example...

            ...look at this terribly
            nasty comet of 1857...

            ...that some people figured
            would splinter the Earth.

            By 1910, Halley's comet
            returned once more.

            But this time, astronomers using
            a new tool, the spectroscope...

            ...had discovered cyanogen gas
            in the tail of a comet.

            Now, cyanogen is a poison.

            The Earth was to pass through
            this poisonous tail.

            The fact that the gas was
            astonishingly, fabulously thin...

            ...reassured almost nobody.

            For example, look at the headlines
            in the Los Angeles Examiner...

            ...for May 9, 1910:

            "Say, Has That Comet
            'Cyanogened' You Yet?"

            "Entire Human Race Due
            For Free Gaseous Bath.

            Expect High Jinks."

            Or take this from the San Francisco
            Chronicle, May 15, 1910:

            "Comet Comes And Husband Reforms."

            "Comet Parties Now Fad In New York."

            Amazing stuff!

            In 1910, people were holding
            comet parties, not so much to...

            ...celebrate the end of the world
            as to make merry before it happened.

            There were entrepreneurs
            who were hawking comet pills.

            I think I'm gonna take one for later.

            And there were those
            who were selling...

            ...gas masks to protect
            against the cyanogen.

            And comet nuttiness
            didn't stop in 1910.

            Long before 1066,
            humans marveled at comets.

            Our generation is beginning
            to understand them.

            Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars...

            ...are small planets made mostly
            of rock and iron.

            Farther out where it's colder,
            are the giant planets...

            ...made mostly of gas.

            But comets originate from
            a great cloud beyond the planets...

            ...almost halfway to the nearest star.

            Occasionally, one falls in...

            ...accelerated by the sun's gravity.

            Because it's made mostly of ice,
            the comet...

            ...evaporates as it approaches
            the sun.

            The vapor is blown back
            by the solar wind...

            ...forming the cometary tail.

            Then it's flung back
            into outer darkness...

            ...its orbit so large...

            ...that it will not return
            for millions of years.

            These are the long-period comets.

            For every one plunging close enough
            to the sun to be discovered...

            ...there may be a billion others...

            ...slowly drifting
            beyond Pluto's orbit.

            Very rarely, a long-period comet is
            captured in the inner solar system...

            ...becoming a short-period comet.

            It passes near a major planet,
            like Saturn.

            The planet provides
            a small gravitational tug...

            ...enough to deflect it
            into a much smaller orbit.

            Though few are captured this way,
            those that are...

            ...become well-known because
            they all return in short intervals.

            Once trapped in the inner
            solar system, among the planets...

            ...the chances of another
            near-collision are increased.

            Here, a second encounter
            with Saturn...

            ...further reduces the comet's
            orbital period to decades.

            A comet may take 10,000 years
            between close planetary encounters.

            But in this computer study,
            we've sped things up.

            A third encounter,
            this time with Jupiter...

            ...further reduces
            the comet's orbital period.

            Now the comet must approach the sun...

            ...and grow a tail every few years.

            Since the dust and gas in the tail
            are lost forever to space...

            ...the comet must slowly be eroding.

            Pieces of it break off.

            Sometimes, as we've seen,
            they even strike the Earth.

            In a few thousand years...

            ...if a short-period comet
            hasn't hit a planet...

            ...it will have evaporated away
            almost entirely...

            ...leaving sand-sized fragments,
            which become meteors...

            ...and its core which, perhaps,
            becomes an asteroid.

            Suppose I were a pretty typical comet.

            And what you would see
            would be a kind of...

            ...tumbling snowball...

            ...spending most of my time out here
            in the outer solar system.

            I'd be a kilometer across.

            I'd be living most of my days...

            ...in the gloom beyond Saturn,
            orbiting the sun.

            But once every century,
            I would find myself...

            ...careening inward,
            faster and faster...

            ...towards the inner solar system.

            By the time I would cross
            the orbit of Jupiter...

            ...on my way to the orbit of Mars...

            ...I'd be heating up because
            I'd be getting closer to the sun.

            I'd be evaporating a little bit.

            Small pieces of dust and ice...

            ...would be blown behind me
            by the solar wind...

            ...forming an incipient cometary tail.

            On the scale of such
            a solar system model...

            ...l, me, a cometary nucleus...

            ...would be smaller than a snowflake.

            Although, when fully developed,
            my tail would be longer...

            ...than the spacing
            between the worlds.

            Now, sooner or later...

            ...comets on these long, elliptical
            trajectories around the sun...

            ...must collide with planets.

            The Earth and the moon...

            ...must have been bombarded
            by comets and asteroids...

            ...the debris from the early history
            of the solar system.

            In interplanetary space, there are
            more small objects than large ones.

            So there must be,
            on a given planetary surface...

            ...many more impacts of small objects
            than of large objects.

            So a thing like the Tunguska impact
            happens on the Earth...

            ...maybe every thousand years.

            But the impact of a giant
            cometary nucleus...

            ...like Halley's comet, let's say...

            ...happens only every
            billion years or so.

            Now, is there evidence
            of past collisions?

            When a large comet...

            ...or a large, rocky asteroid
            hits a planet...

            ...it makes a bowl-shaped crater.

            The well-preserved impact craters on
            Earth were all formed fairly recently.

            The older ones have been softened,
            filled in or rubbed out...

            ...by running water
            and mountain building.

            Impacts make craters on other worlds
            and about as often.

            But when the air is thin...

            ...when water rarely flows,
            when mountain building is feeble...

            ...the ancient craters are retained.

            This is the case on the moon
            and Mercury and Mars...

            ...our neighboring
            terrestrial planets.

            They huddle around the sun...

            ...their source of heat and light...

            ...a little bit like campers
            around a fire.

            They are about
            4? billion years old.

            And all bear witness
            to an age long gone...

            ...of major collisions...

            ...which do not happen at that scale
            and frequency anymore.

            If we move out past...

            ...the terrestrial planets
            beyond Mars...

            ...we find ourselves in a different
            regime of the solar system...

            ...in the realm of Jupiter...

            ...and the other giant,
            or Jovian planets.

            These are great worlds
            composed largely of the gases...

            ...hydrogen and helium,
            some other stuff too.

            When we look at the surface,
            we do not see a solid surface...

            ...but only an occasional patch
            of atmosphere...

            ...and a complex array
            of multicolored clouds.

            These are serious planets...

            ...not fragmentary little world-lets
            like the Earth.

            In fact, 1000 Earths would fit...

            ...in the volume of Jupiter.

            If a comet or asteroid were to...

            ...accidentally impact Jupiter, it would
            be very unlikely to leave a crater.

            It might make a momentary hole
            in the clouds, but that's it.

            Nevertheless, we know
            that the outer solar system...

            ...has been subject to
            a many-billion-year history...

            ...of impact cratering.

            Jupiter's moon Callisto is studded
            with thousands of craters.

            Clear evidence of ancient
            collisions beyond Mars.

            And there are craters
            on other moons of Jupiter.

            Most of the thousands of
            large craters on our own moon...

            ...were excavated
            billions of years ago.

            But were any recorded
            in historical times?

            The odds against it
            are about 1000-to-one.

            (BELL RINGS)

            Nevertheless, there's a possible
            eyewitness account...

            ...of just such an event.

            It was the Sunday before the
            feast of Saint John the Baptist...

            ...in the summer of 1178.

            The monks of Canterbury Cathedral had
            completed their evening prayers...

            ...and were about to retire
            for the night.

            The scholarly brother, Gervase...

            ...returned to his cell to read...

            ...while some of the others...

            ...went outside to enjoy
            the gentle June air.

            (PLAYS FLUTE)

            In the midst of their recreation...

            ...they chanced to witness
            an astonishing sight:

            A violent explosion on the moon.

            This was a time...

            ...when the heavens were
            thought to be changeless.

            The moon, the stars and the planets
            were deemed pure...

            ...because they followed
            an unvarying celestial routine.

            They were expected to behave
            without unseemly disruptions...

            ...like monks in a monastery.

            Was it wise to discuss such a vision?

            In every time and culture...

            ...there are pressures to conform
            to the prevailing prejudices.

            But there are also,
            in every place and epoch...

            ...those who value the truth,
            who record the evidence faithfully.

            Future generations are in their debt.

            A fire on the moon.

            Might it be some portent
            of ill fortune?

            Should the chronicler
            of the monastery be told?

            Was this event an apparition
            of the evil one?

            Gervase of Canterbury was
            a historian...

            ...considered today a reliable
            reporter of political...

            ...and cultural events of his time.

            This is his account of the
            eyewitness testimony he was given:

            "Now there was a bright new moon...

            ...and as usual in that phase...

            ...its horns were tilted
            toward the east.

            And suddenly the upper horn
            split in two.

            From the midpoint of this division,
            a flaming torch sprang up...

            ...spewing out
            over a considerable distance...

            ...fire, hot coals and sparks.

            After these transformations,"
            Gervase continued...

            ..."the moon from horn to horn
            that is along its whole length...

            ...took on a blackish appearance."

            Gervase took depositions
            from all the eyewitnesses.

            He later wrote:

            "The writer was given this report by
            men who saw it with their own eyes...

            ...and are prepared to stake
            their honor on an oath...

            ...that they have made no addition
            or falsification."

            Gervase committed the account
            to paper...

            ...enabling astronomers
            eight centuries later...

            ...to try and reconstruct
            what really happened.

            It may be that 200 years
            before Chaucer...

            ...five monks saw an event
            more wonderful...

            ...than many another celebrated
            Canterbury tale.

            If a small drifting mountain
            were to hit the moon...

            ...it would set our satellite
            swinging like a bell.

            Eventually, the tremors would
            die down, but not in a mere 800 years.

            So is the moon still quivering
            from that impact?

            The Apollo astronauts emplaced arrays
            of special mirrors on the moon.

            Reflectors made by
            French scientists...

            ...were also put on the moon
            by Soviet Lunakhod vehicles.

            When a laser beam from Earth strikes
            a mirror and bounces back...

            ...the roundtrip travel time
            can be measured.

            At the McDonald Observatory
            of the University of Texas...

            ...a laser beam is prepared for firing
            at the reflectors on the moon...

            ...380,000 kilometers away.

            By multiplying the travel time
            by the speed of light...

            ...the distance to that spot
            can be determined...

            ...to a precision of
            7 to 10 centimeters:

            The width of a hand.

            When such measurements are
            repeated over years...

            ...even an extremely slight wobble
            in the moon's motion...

            ...can be determined.

            The accuracy is phenomenal.

            The error is much less...

            ...than one-millionth of a percent.

            The moon, it turns out,
            is gently swinging like a bell...

            ...just as if it had been
            hit by an asteroid...

            ...less than 1000 years ago.

            (RINGING)

            So there may be physical evidence
            in the age of space flight...

            ...for the account of the Canterbury
            monks in the 12th century.

            If 800 years ago
            a big asteroid hit the moon...

            ...the crater should be
            prominent today...

            ...still surrounded by bright rays...

            ...thin streamers of dust
            spewed out by the impact.

            In billions of years,
            lunar rays are eroded...

            ...but not in hundreds.

            And there is a recent ray crater
            called Giordano Bruno...

            ...in the region of the moon
            where an explosion was reported...

            ...in 1178.

            The entire evolution of the moon...

            ...is a story of catastrophes.

            4 1/2 billion years ago...

            ...the moon was accreting
            from interplanetary boulders...

            ...and craters were forming
            all over its surface.

            The energy so released
            helped melt the crust.

            After most of this debris was swept up
            by the moon, the surface cooled.

            But about 3.9 billion years ago...

            ...a great asteroid impacted.

            It generated an expanding shock wave
            and re-melted some of the surface.

            The resulting basin
            was then flooded...

            ...probably by dark lava...

            ...producing one of
            the dry seas on the moon.

            More recent impacts excavated
            craters with bright rays...

            ...named after Eratosthenes
            and Copernicus.

            The familiar features
            of the man in the moon...

            ...are a chronicle of ancient impacts.

            Most of the original asteroids
            were swept up...

            ...in the making
            of the moon and planets.

            Many still orbit the sun
            in the asteroid belt.

            Some, themselves almost fractured
            by gravity tides...

            ...and by impacts
            with other asteroids...

            ...have been captured by planets:
            Phobos around Mars, for example...

            ...or a close moon of Jupiter
            called Amalthea.

            Similar to the asteroid belt
            are the rings of Saturn...

            ...composed of millions
            of small, tumbling, icy moonlets.

            Maybe the rings of Saturn
            are a moon...

            ...which was prevented from
            forming by the tides of Saturn.

            Or maybe it's the remains
            of a moon that wandered too close...

            ...and was torn apart by
            the tides of Saturn.

            It's certainly a lovely place.

            Jupiter also has
            a newly discovered ring system...

            ...which is invisible from the Earth.

            Now, there is a curious argument...

            ...alleging major recent collisions
            in the solar system...

            ...proposed by a psychiatrist...

            ...named Immanuel Velikovsky in 1950.

            He suggested...

            ...that an object of planetary mass,
            which he called a comet...

            ...was somehow produced
            in the Jupiter system.

            He doesn't say exactly
            how it's produced...

            ...but maybe...

            ...it's spat out...

            ...of Jupiter.

            Anyway, however it was made
            some 3500 years ago, he imagines...

            ...it made repeated
            close encounters with Mars...

            ...with the Earth-moon system...

            ...having as entertaining
            biblical consequences...

            ...the parting of the Red Sea so that
            Moses and the Israelites could...

            ...safely avoid the host of pharaoh...

            ...and the stopping of
            the Earth's rotation when...

            ...Joshua commanded the sun
            to stand still in Gibeon.

            He also imagined that
            there was extensive flooding...

            ...and the volcanoes all over
            the Earth at that time.

            Well, then after
            a very complicated game...

            ...of interplanetary billiards
            is completed...

            ...Velikovsky proposed
            that this comet...

            ...entered into a stable,
            almost perfectly circular orbit...

            ...becoming...

            ...the planet Venus...

            ...which he claimed
            never existed until then.

            Now, these ideas are
            almost certainly wrong.

            There's no objection
            in astronomy to collisions.

            We've seen collision fragments...

            ...and evidence throughout
            the solar system.

            The problem is with recent
            and major collisions.

            In any scale model like this...

            ...it's impossible to have both
            the sizes of the planets...

            ...and the sizes of their orbits
            to the same scale...

            ...because then the planets
            would be too small to see.

            If the planets were really
            to scale in such a model...

            ...as grains of dust...

            ...it would then be entirely clear...

            ...that a comet entering
            the inner solar system...

            ...would have a negligible chance
            of colliding with a planet...

            ...in only a few thousand years.

            Moreover...

            ...Venus is a rocky and metallic...

            ...hydrogen-poor world...

            ...whereas Jupiter, where Velikovsky
            imagines it comes from...

            ...is made of almost nothing
            but hydrogen.

            There is no energy source in Jupiter
            to eject planets or comets.

            If one did enter
            the inner solar system...

            ...there is no way it could stop
            the Earth from rotating.

            And if it could, there's no way
            Earth could start rotating again...

            ...at anything like 24 hours a day.

            There's no geological evidence
            for flooding and volcanism...

            ...3500 years ago.

            Babylonian astronomers
            observed Venus...

            ...in its present stable orbit...

            ...before Velikovsky said it existed.

            And so on.

            There are many hypotheses
            in science which are wrong.

            That's all right. It's the aperture
            to finding out what's right.

            Science is a self-correcting process.

            To be accepted,
            new ideas must survive...

            ...the most rigorous standards
            of evidence and scrutiny.

            The worst aspect of
            the Velikovsky affair is not...

            ...that many of his ideas were
            wrong or silly...

            ...or in gross contradiction
            to the facts.

            Rather, the worst aspect is
            that some scientists...

            ...attempted to suppress
            Velikovsky's ideas.

            The suppression of uncomfortable ideas
            may be common in religion...

            ...or in politics,
            but it is not the path to knowledge.

            And there's no place for it
            in the endeavor of science.

            We do not know beforehand...

            ...where fundamental insights
            will arise from...

            ...about our mysterious
            and lovely solar system.

            And the history of our study
            of the solar system shows clearly...

            ...that accepted and conventional
            ideas are often wrong...

            ...and that fundamental insights...

            ...can arise from
            the most unexpected sources.

            We've evolved on the planet Earth...

            ...and so we find it
            a congenial place.

            But just next door is Venus...

            ...until recently, enveloped
            in mystery.

            It has almost the same size
            and mass as the Earth.

            Might our sister world
            be a balmy summer planet...

            ...a little warmer than the Earth
            because it's closer to the sun?

            Are there craters, volcanoes,
            mountains, oceans, life?

            The first to look at Venus through
            a telescope was Galileo in 1609.

            But all he could see
            was a featureless disk.

            As optical telescopes got bigger,
            that's all anybody could see:

            A disk with no details on it at all.

            Venus evidently was covered
            with an opaque layer...

            ...thick clouds concealing the surface.

            For centuries, even the composition
            of the clouds of Venus was unknown.

            I mean, you could go outside, look up,
            see Venus with the naked eye...

            ...observe sunlight reflected
            from the clouds of Venus.

            What were you looking at?
            What were the clouds made of?

            Nobody knew.

            As a result, imagination ran riot.

            The absence of anything you
            could see on Venus...

            ...led some scientists and others
            to deduce...

            ...that the surface was a swamp.

            The argument, if we can dignify it
            with such a phrase...

            ...went like this:

            "I can't see a thing
            on the surface of Venus."

            "Why not?"

            "Because it's covered with
            a dense layer of clouds."

            "What are clouds made of?"

            "Water, of course. Therefore, Venus
            must have a lot of water on it."

            "Then the surface must be wet."

            "If the surface is wet,
            it's probably a swamp.

            If there's a swamp, there's ferns.
            If there's ferns...

            ...maybe there's even dinosaurs."

            Observation:
            You couldn't see a thing.

            Conclusion: dinosaurs.

            If just looking at Venus
            was so unproductive...

            ...what else could you do?

            The next clue came from
            early work with that:

            A glass prism.

            An intense beam of ordinary white
            light is passed through a narrow slit...

            ...and then through the prism.

            The result is to spread
            the white light out...

            ...into its constituent
            rainbow of colors.

            This rainbow pattern
            is called a spectrum.

            Think about it.
            White light enters the prism...

            ...what comes out of the prism
            is colored light.

            Lots of colors.
            Where did they come from?

            They must've been hiding
            in the white light.

            White light must be
            a mixture of many colors.

            Here we see the spectrum
            running from...

            ...violet, blue, green,
            yellow, orange, to red.

            Since we see these colors, we call
            this the spectrum of visible light.

            The sun emits lots of visible light.
            The air is transparent to it.

            So our eyes evolved
            to work in visible light.

            But there are many other frequencies
            of light which our eyes can't detect.

            Beyond the violet
            is the ultraviolet.

            It's just as real, but you need
            instruments to detect it.

            Beyond the ultraviolet are
            the x-rays and then the gamma rays.

            On the other side of visible light,
            beyond the red...

            ...is the infrared,
            again real, again invisible.

            Beyond the infrared
            are the radio waves.

            Now, this entire range from
            the gamma rays way over there...

            ...to the radio waves
            all the way over here...

            ...are simply different
            kinds of light.

            They differ only in the frequency.

            They're all useful, by the way,
            in astronomy.

            But because of the limitations
            of our eyes...

            ...we have a prejudice,
            a bias, a chauvinism...

            ...to this tiny rainbow band
            of visible light.

            Now, a spectrum can be used
            in a simple and elegant way...

            ...to determine the chemical
            composition of the atmosphere...

            ...of a planet or star.

            Different atoms and molecules
            absorb...

            ...different frequencies
            or colors of light.

            And those absorbed or missing
            frequencies appear as black lines...

            ...in the spectrum of the light
            we receive from the planet or star.

            Each and every substance
            has a characteristic fingerprint...

            ...a spectral signature...

            ...which permits it to be detected
            over a great distance.

            As a result, the gases
            in the atmosphere of Venus...

            ...at a distance of
            60 million kilometers...

            ...their composition's been determined
            from the Earth.

            It's amazing to me still, we can tell
            what a thing is made out of...

            ...at an enormous distance away,
            without ever touching it.

            Our eyes can't see in the near
            infrared part of the spectrum.

            But our instruments can.

            Here's the absorption pattern
            of lots and lots of carbon dioxide:

            Dark lines in characteristic patterns
            at specific frequencies.

            You'd detect a different set
            of infrared lines...

            ...if, say, water vapor were present.

            If Venus were really soaking wet,
            then you could determine that...

            ...by finding the pattern
            of water vapor in its atmosphere.

            But around 1920, when this experiment
            was first performed...

            ...the Venus atmosphere seemed to
            have not a hint...

            ...not a smidgen, not a trace
            of water vapor above the clouds.

            And so instead of a swampy,
            soaking wet surface...

            ...it was suggested that Venus
            was bone-dry, a desert planet...

            ...with clouds composed
            of fine silicate dust.

            But later, spectroscopic
            observations revealed...

            ...the characteristic
            absorption lines...

            ...of an enormous amount
            of carbon dioxide.

            Scientists thought there must be lots
            of carbon compounds on the surface...

            ...making this a planet
            covered with petroleum.

            Others agreed that the atmosphere was
            dry but thought the surface was wet.

            With all that CO 2,
            it had to be carbonated water.

            Venus, they thought, was covered
            with a vast ocean of seltzer.

            The first hint of the true situation
            on Venus came...

            ...not from the visible, ultraviolet
            or infrared part of the spectrum...

            ...but from over here
            in the radio region.

            We're used to the idea of
            radio signals from intelligent life...

            ...or at least semi-intelligent life,
            radio and television stations.

            But there are all kinds of reasons
            why natural objects emit radio waves.

            One reason is that they're hot.

            And when, in 1956...

            ...Venus was, for the first time,
            observed by a radio telescope...

            ...the planet was discovered
            to be emitting radio waves...

            ...as if it were at
            an extremely high temperature.

            But the real demonstration that Venus'
            surface was astonishingly hot...

            ...came when the first spacecraft
            penetrated the clouds of Venus...

            ...and slowly settled on the surface
            of the nearest planet.

            These were the unmanned spacecraft
            of the Soviet Venera series.

            In our spaceship of the imagination,
            we retrace their course.

            From a distance, our sister planet
            seems serene and peaceful...

            ...its clouds motionless.

            These clouds are near the top
            of a great ocean of air...

            ...about 100 kilometers thick,
            composed mainly of carbon dioxide.

            There's some nitrogen, a little
            water vapor and other gases...

            ...but only the merest trace
            of hydrocarbons.

            The clouds turn out to be,
            not water...

            ...but a concentrated solution
            of sulfuric acid.

            Even in the high clouds...

            ...Venus is a thoroughly nasty place.

            The clouds are stained yellow
            by sulfur.

            There are great lightning storms.

            As we descend, there are
            increasing amounts...

            ...of the noxious gas sulfur dioxide.

            The pressures become so high
            that early Venera spacecraft...

            ...were crushed like old tin cans...

            ...by the weight
            of the surrounding atmosphere.

            Beneath the clouds
            in the dense, clear air...

            ...it's as bright as
            on an overcast day on Earth.

            But the atmosphere is so thick
            that the ground seems to ripple...

            ...and distort.

            The atmospheric pressure down here is
            90 times that on Earth.

            The temperature is 380 degrees
            centigrade, 900 degrees Fahrenheit.

            Hotter than the hottest
            household oven.

            This is a world
            marked by searing heat...

            ...crushing pressures,
            sulfurous gases...

            ...and a desolate, reddish landscape.

            Far from the balmy paradise
            imagined by some early scientists...

            ...Venus is the one place
            in the solar system most like hell.

            But today, as in ancient tradition...

            ...there are travelers who will dare
            a visit to the underworld.

            Venera 9 was the first spacecraft
            in human history...

            ...to return a photograph
            from the surface of Venus.

            It found the rocks curiously eroded...

            ...perhaps by the corrosive gases...

            ...perhaps because
            the temperature is so high...

            ...that the rocks are partly molten
            and sluggishly flow.

            The Soviet Venera spacecraft,
            their electronics long ago fried...

            ...are slowly corroding
            on the surface of Venus.

            They are the first spaceships
            from Earth...

            ...ever to land on another planet.

            The reason Venus is like hell...

            ...seems to be what's called
            the greenhouse effect.

            Ordinary visible sunlight penetrates
            the clouds and heats the surface.

            But the dense atmosphere
            blankets the surface...

            ...and prevents it from
            cooling off to space.

            An atmosphere 90 times
            as dense as ours...

            ...made of carbon dioxide,
            water vapor and other gases...

            ...lets in visible light
            from the sun...

            ...but will not let out the infrared
            light radiated by the surface.

            The temperature rises...

            ...until the infrared radiation
            trickling out to space...

            ...just balances the sunlight
            reaching the surface.

            The greenhouse effect can make
            an Earth-like world...

            ...into a planetary inferno.

            In this caldron, there's not likely
            to be anything alive...

            ...even creatures
            very different from us.

            Organic and other conceivable
            biological molecules...

            ...would simply fall to pieces.

            The hell of Venus is
            in stark contrast...

            ...with the comparative heaven
            of its neighboring world...

            ...our little planetary home,
            the Earth.

            Here, the atmosphere is
            90 times thinner.

            Here, the carbon dioxide
            and water vapor...

            ...make a modest greenhouse effect...

            ...which heats the ground
            above the freezing point of water.

            Without it, our oceans
            would be frozen solid.

            A little greenhouse effect
            is a good thing.

            But Venus is an ominous reminder...

            ...that on a world
            rather like the Earth...

            ...things can go wrong.

            There is no guarantee that our planet
            will always be so hospitable.

            To maintain this clement world...

            ...we must understand it
            and appreciate it.

            The Earth is a place to our eyes...

            ...more beautiful than
            any other that we know.

            But this beauty has been
            sculpted by change:

            Gentle, almost undetectable change...

            ...and sudden, violent change.

            In the cosmos,
            there is no refuge from change.

            The Sphinx:
            human head, lion's body...

            ...constructed more than
            5500 years ago.

            That face was once crisp
            and cleanly rendered...

            ...like this paw I am standing on.

            The paw has been buried
            in the sand until recently...

            ...and protected from erosion.

            The face is now muddled
            and softened...

            ...because of thousands of years
            of sandblasting in the desert...

            ...and a little rainfall.

            In New York City, there is an obelisk
            called Cleopatra's Needle...

            ...which comes from Egypt.

            In only a little more than a century
            in New York's Central Park...

            ...the inscriptions on that obelisk
            have been almost totally obliterated.

            Not by sand and water...

            ...but by smog
            and industrial pollution.

            A bit like the atmosphere of Venus.

            Slow erosion wipes out information.

            On the Earth...

            ...mountain ranges are destroyed
            by erosion...

            ...in maybe tens of millions
            of years...

            ...small impact craters in maybe
            hundreds of thousands of years.

            And the greatest artifacts
            of human beings...

            ...in thousands
            or tens of thousands of years.

            In addition to such slow
            and uniform processes...

            ...there are rare but sudden
            catastrophes.

            The Sphinx is missing a nose.

            In an act of idle desecration,
            some soldiers once shot it off.

            If you wait long enough,
            everything changes.

            Slow, uniform processes,
            unheralded events:

            The sting of a sand grain...

            ...the fall of a drop of water...

            ...can, over the ages,
            totally rework the landscape.

            And rare, violent processes...

            ...exceptional events
            that will not recur in a lifetime...

            ...also make major changes.

            Both the insignificant
            and the extraordinary...

            ...are the architects
            of the natural world.

            The destruction of trees
            and grasslands...

            ...makes the surface
            of the Earth brighter.

            It reflects more sunlight
            back to space and cools our planet.

            After we discovered fire...

            ...we began to incinerate forests
            intentionally...

            ...to clear the land
            by a process called...

            ..."slash and burn" agriculture.

            And today, forests and grasslands
            are being destroyed...

            ...frivolously, carelessly
            by humans who are...

            ...heedless of the beauty
            of our cousins the trees...

            ...and ignorant of the possible
            climatic catastrophes...

            ...which large-scale burning
            of forests may bring.

            (TREES BREAKING)

            The indiscriminate destruction
            of vegetation...

            ...may alter the global climate...

            ...in ways that no scientist
            can yet predict.

            It has already deadened
            large patches...

            ...of the Earth's
            life-supporting skin.

            And yet, we ravage the Earth
            at an accelerated pace...

            ...as if it belonged
            to this one generation...

            ...as if it were ours
            to do with as we please.

            The Earth has mechanisms
            to cleanse itself...

            ...to neutralize the toxic substances
            in its system.

            But these mechanisms work
            only up to a point.

            Beyond some critical threshold,
            they break down.

            The damage becomes irreversible.

            Our generation must choose.

            Which do we value more:
            short-term profits...

            ...or the long-term habitability
            of our planetary home?

            The world is divided politically.

            But ecologically
            it is tightly interwoven.

            There are no useless threads
            in the fabric of the ecosystem.

            If you cut any one of them,
            you will unravel many others.

            We have uncovered other worlds...

            ...with choking atmospheres
            and deadly surfaces.

            Shall we then re-create
            these hells on Earth?

            We have encountered desolate moons
            and barren asteroids.

            Shall we then scar and crater this
            blue-green world in their likeness?

            Natural catastrophes are rare.

            But they come often enough.

            We need not force the hand of nature.

            If we ruin the Earth,
            there is no place else to go.

            This is not a disposable world.

            And we are not yet able
            to re-engineer other planets.

            The cruelest desert on Earth...

            ...is far more hospitable
            than any place on Mars.

            The bright, sandy surface
            and dusty atmosphere of Mars...

            ...reflect enough sunlight
            back to space to cool the planet...

            ...freezing out all its water,
            locking it in a perpetual ice age.

            Human activities brighten
            our landscape and our atmosphere.

            Might this ultimately
            make an ice age here?

            At the same time, we are releasing
            vast quantities of carbon dioxide...

            ...increasing the greenhouse effect.

            The Earth need not
            resemble Venus very closely...

            ...for it to become
            barren and lifeless.

            It may not take much
            to destabilize the Earth's climate...

            ...to convert this heaven,
            our only home in the cosmos...

            ...into a kind of hell.

            The study of the global climate,
            the sun's influence...

            ...the comparison of the Earth
            with other worlds...

            These are subjects in their
            earliest stages of development.

            They are funded poorly
            and grudgingly.

            Meanwhile, we continue to load the
            Earth's atmosphere with materials...

            ...about whose long-term influence
            we are almost entirely ignorant.

            There are worlds that began with
            as much apparent promise as Earth.

            But something went wrong.

            Knowing that worlds can die
            alerts us to our danger.

            If a visitor arrived from another
            world, what account would we give...

            ...of our stewardship
            of the planet Earth?

            In the history of the solar system,
            have worlds ever been destroyed?

            Most of the moons in the outer
            solar system have craters on them...

            ...made by cometary impacts.

            Some have such
            large craters though...

            ...that if the impacting comets
            had been just a little bit bigger...

            ...the moons would have
            been shattered.

            What would the results of
            such a collision look like?

            (EXPLOSION)

            Maybe a planetary ring.

            The idea has been growing
            that little worlds are...

            ...every now and then,
            demolished by a cometary impact.

            The fragments then slowly coalesce,
            and a moon arises again...

            ...from its own ashes.

            Some moons may have been destroyed
            and reconstituted many times.

            For our own world,
            the peril is more subtle.

            Since this series was
            first broadcast...

            ...the dangers of the increasing
            greenhouse effect...

            ...have become much more clear.

            We burn fossil fuels, like coal
            and gas and petroleum...

            ...putting more carbon dioxide
            into the atmosphere...

            ...and thereby heating the Earth.

            The hellish conditions on Venus
            are a reminder that...

            ...this is serious business.

            Computer models that
            successfully explain...

            ...the climates of other planets...

            ...predict the deaths of forests...

            ...parched croplands,
            the flooding of coastal cities...

            ...environmental refugees...

            ...widespread disasters
            in the next century...

            ...unless we change our ways.

            What do we have to do?

            Four things.

            One: much more efficient use
            of fossil fuels.

            Why not cars that get 70 miles
            a gallon instead of 25?

            Two: research and development
            on safe alternative energy sources...

            ...especially solar power.

            Three: reforestation
            on a grand scale.

            And four: helping to bring
            the billion poorest people...

            ...on the planet
            to self-sufficiency...

            ...which is the key step
            in curbing world population growth.

            Every one of these steps makes sense
            apart from greenhouse warming.

            No one has proposed
            that the trouble with Venus is...

            ...that there once was Venusians
            who drove fuel-inefficient cars.

            But our nearest neighbor,
            nevertheless, is a stark warning...

            ...on the possible fate
            of an Earth-like world.

            The age and size of the cosmos

            are written in light.

            The nature of beauty and
            the substance of the stars,

            the laws of space and time...

            they were there all along,

            but we never saw them...

            until we devised
            a more powerful way of seeing.

            The story of this awakening
            has many beginnings

            and no ending.

            Its heroes come from many times
            and places--

            an Ancient Chinese philosopher,



            a wizard who amazed the caliphs
            of 11th-century Iraq,

            a poor German orphan enslaved
            to a harsh master.

            Each one brought us
            a little closer

            to unlocking the secrets
            hidden in light.

            Most of their names
            are forever lost to us,

            but somewhere, long ago,
            someone glanced up

            to see light perform
            one of its magic tricks.

            Who knows?

            Maybe that quirk of light

            inspired the very first artist.

            Where did all this come from?

            How did we evolve
            from small wandering bands

            of hunters and gatherers living
            beneath the stars

            to become the builders
            of a global civilization?



            How did we get from there
            to here?

            There's no one answer.

            Climate change,
            the domestication of fire,

            the invention of tools,
            language, agriculture

            all played a role.

            Maybe there was
            something else, too.

            In China,
            more than 2,000 years ago,

            a philosopher named Mo Tze
            is said to have observed

            that light could be made
            to paint a picture

            inside a locked treasure room.

            This was the description
            of the first camera...

            the camera obscura,

            the prototype of all
            image-forming cameras,

            including the one that's
            bringing you this picture.

            Taking advantage of this funny
            thing that light does

            resulted in what could be
            called the first movie.

            Mo Tze, master of light, worked
            against all forms of darkness.

            A military genius

            who only used his talents
            to prevent violence,

            he was legendary for traveling

            among the kingdoms
            of the warring states,

            employing ingenious strategies

            to talk kings out
            of going to war.

            He was one of the first
            to dream of universal love

            and an end to poverty
            and other forms of inequality;

            of government for the people...

            and to argue against
            blind obedience

            to ritual and authority.

            In his writings, you can find

            early stirrings
            of the scientific approach.

            By Mo Tze's time, the Chinese
            had already been recording

            their thoughts in books
            for at least a thousand years.

            Still, our knowledge of him
            is only fragmentary.

            It consists largely
            of the collection of essays

            attributed to him
            and his disciples.

            In one of them,
            entitled "Against Fate,"

            a three-pronged test
            for every doctrine is proposed.

            Question its basis--

            ask if it can be verified

            by the sights and senses
            of common people--

            ask how it is to be applied

            and if it will benefit
            the greatest number.

            Mo Tze was extremely popular,

            but a few hundred years
            after his death,

            Qin Shi Huang,
            the first emperor,

            and unifier of China,
            took power.

            He took a continent
            and turned it into a nation

            that now bears his name... China.

            Most of us know Emperor Qin
            for the army of 7,000

            terra cotta warriors
            that guard his tomb.

            In Emperor Qin's drive

            to consolidate
            his far-flung empire,

            he took drastic measures

            to standardize everything
            within it.

            This included mandating
            a single coinage,

            making uniform all weights
            and measures,

            the widths of carts and roads,
            as well as the precise way

            the Chinese language was
            to be written,

            including what you were
            allowed to write and think.

            Emperor Qin's philosophy--
            the only one permitted--

            was called "legalism,"

            which is just what
            it sounded like,

            do as the law says... or else.

            It's a philosophy that's
            not highly conducive

            to questioning authority.

            ...that all the books of
            the hundred schools of thought

            shall be be burned,

            that anyone who uses history
            to criticize the present

            shall have his family executed.

            The works of
            MoTze and Confucius

            and other philosophers
            were destroyed

            in the world's first
            book burning.

            Hundreds of scholars
            bravely resisted

            by trying to preserve
            the forbidden books.

            They were buried alive
            in the capitol.

            Science needs the light
            of free expression to flourish.

            It depends on the fearless
            questioning of authority,

            the open exchange of ideas.

            Sparks of curiosity
            in the writings of Mo Tze

            and his disciples were
            effectively stomped out.

            It would be another thousand
            years before the next movie.

            Luckily, our Ship
            of the Imagination

            can take us anywhere
            in space... and time.

            The ancient Chinese
            and Greeks observed

            that light could be made

            to do wonderful things--
            but no one asked that question

            favored by small children
            and geniuses alike. Why?

            Until a thousand years ago...

            In the city of Basra, Iraq,

            there lived
            another master of light.

            Ibn al-Hazen had a passionate
            desire to understand nature.

            He questioned everything,

            especially those things that
            everyone else took for granted.

            "How do we see?" he asked.

            Some of the great authorities
            who came before him

            had taught that rays come out
            of our eyes and travel

            to the objects we see
            before returning to our eyes.

            But al-Hazen reasoned that
            the stars were too far distant

            for something in our eyes
            to travel all the way to them

            and back in the blink
            of an eye.

            Excellent reasoning,
            but al-Hazen didn't stop there.

            He searched for ways to compel
            nature to divulge her secrets.

            His culture was open
            to new ideas and questioning.

            It was the golden age
            of science

            in the Islamic world.

            One that stretched from Cordoba
            in Spain

            all the way to Samarkand
            in Central Asia.

            Christian and Jewish scholars
            were honored guests

            at the research institutes
            of Baghdad, Cairo,

            and other Islamic capitols.

            Instead of burning books,
            the caliphs sent emissaries

            around the world
            in search of books.

            The caliphs lavishly funded
            projects to translate, study,

            and preserve them
            for future generations.

            Much of the light of Ancient
            Greek science would have been

            permanently extinguished
            without their efforts.

            The reawakening to science
            that took place in Europe,

            hundreds of years later,
            was kindled by a flame

            that had been long tended

            by Islamic scholars
            and scientists.

            The Arabs also imported ideas
            from India to the West,

            including the so-called
            Arabic numerals

            that we all use today,

            and the concept of zero...

            which comes in handy

            when you want to write
            "billions and billions."

            Arabic astronomy was
            so influential,

            that we still call most
            of the bright stars

            by their Arabic names.

            And the "al's" in algebra,
            algorithm, alchemy, and alcohol

            are just some
            of the traces left

            from the time when Arabic
            was the language of science.

            In the 11th century,
            Ibn al-Hazen set about trying

            to test his ideas about light
            and how we see.

            So we devised an experiment
            to determine how light moves.

            We erected a tent
            in full daylight

            and sealed it tightly so that
            only a single ray of light

            could pierce its inner darkness.

            With little more than his brains

            and a straight
            piece of wood-- a ruler--

            al-Hazen had accomplished
            a great leap forward

            in the history of science.

            He discovered that
            light moves in straight lines.

            But he was just getting started.

            Al-Hazen figured out that
            the key to forming any image--

            whether you're talking about
            an eye or camera obscura--

            is a small opening to restrict
            the light that can enter

            an otherwise darkened chamber.

            That aperture
            excludes the chaos

            of extraneous light rays
            that surround us.

            The smaller the aperture,

            the fewer directions
            that light can come from.

            And that makes
            the image sharper.

            So instead of being blinded
            by the light,

            we can see everything
            it has to show us.

            Al-Hazen made his own
            camera obscura

            and dazzled the caliphs.

            A camera obscura works best
            in bright light.

            The stars of the night sky
            are way too dim for this.

            We somehow need a bigger
            opening to collect light,

            but we also need
            to maintain focus.

            A telescope collects light

            from any spot
            in its field of view

            across the entire lens
            or mirror,

            an opening much larger
            than the camera obscura hole.

            This is one
            of the first telescopes...

            the one that Galileo looked
            through in 1609.

            With it, he pulled aside
            the heavy curtain of night

            and began to discover
            the cosmos.

            The lens made it possible

            for a telescope to have a much
            larger light-collecting area

            than our eyes have.

            Big buckets catch more rain
            than small ones.

            Modern telescopes have larger
            collecting areas,

            highly sensitive detectors,

            and they track the same object
            for hours at a time

            to accumulate as much
            of its light as possible.

            Space-based telescopes
            such as the Hubble,

            have captured light
            from the most distant

            and ancient galaxies,

            giving us vastly clearer
            pictures of the cosmos.

            Al-Hazen discovered how images
            are formed by light,

            but that was far
            from his greatest achievement.

            Ibn al-Hazen was the first
            person ever

            to set down
            the rules of science.

            He created
            an error-correcting mechanism,

            a systematic and relentless way

            to sift out misconceptions
            in our thinking.

            Finding truth is difficult...

            and the road to it is rough.

            As seekers after truth,

            you will be wise to withhold
            judgment and not simply put

            your trust in the writings
            of the ancients.

            You must question and critically
            examine those writings

            from every side.

            You must submit only
            to argument and experiment

            and not to the sayings
            of any person.

            For every human being
            is vulnerable

            to all kinds of imperfection.

            As seekers after truth,

            we must also suspect
            and question

            our own ideas as we perform
            our investigations,

            to avoid falling into prejudice
            or careless thinking.

            Take this course, and truth
            will be revealed to you.

            This is the method of science.

            So powerful that it's carried
            our robotic emissaries

            to the edge of
            the solar system and beyond.

            It has doubled our lifespan,

            made the lost worlds
            of the past

            come alive.

            Science has enabled us
            to predict events

            in the distant future...

            and to communicate with each
            other at the speed of light,

            as I am with you,
            right at this moment.

            This way of thinking
            has given us powers

            that al-Hazen himself
            would have regarded as wizardry.

            But it was he who put us
            on this rough, endless road.

            And now it has taken us
            to a place

            where even light itself
            is enshrouded in darkness.

            Light has properties unlike
            anything else

            in the realm
            of human existence.

            Take the speed of light.

            The basic particle of light,
            the photon,

            is born traveling
            at the speed of light

            as it emerges from
            an atom or a molecule.

            A photon never knows
            any other speed,

            and we've not found another
            phenomenon that accelerates

            from zero to top speed
            instantaneously.

            Nothing else
            could move as fast.

            When we try to accelerate other
            particles closer and closer

            to the speed of light,
            they resist more and more,

            as though they're getting
            heavier and heavier.

            No experiment yet devised

            has ever made a particle
            move as fast as light.

            What was that?

            You hear something?

            Where was I? Oh, yeah.

            I don't know anything else
            in life that behaves like light.

            I cannot reconcile
            its strange properties

            with everything else
            my senses tell me.

            Our urge to trust
            our senses overpowers

            what our measuring devices
            tell us about

            the actual nature of reality.

            Our senses work fine
            for life-size objects

            moving at mammal speeds,

            but are ill-adapted for the
            wonderland laws of lightspeed.

            We don't even know why
            there's a cosmic speed limit.

            Time stands still when you're
            traveling at the speed of light.

            What is light, anyway?

            Isaac Newton's enduring
            fascination with light

            began when he was a child...

            in this very house.

            By the time he was in his 20s,
            Newton became the first person

            to decipher the mystery
            of the rainbow.

            Newton discovered that some
            light, or white light,

            is a mixture of all the colors
            of the rainbow.

            Major discovery.

            He named the displays of colors
            a "spectrum"

            from the Latin for "phantom"
            or "apparition."

            Begging your pardon,
            Master Newton,

            the cook frets that your dinner
            will spoil, sir.

            No, Isaac, don't
            put the magnifying glass down!

            Something even more amazing
            is hidden in the light--

            a code, a key to the cosmos.

            Isaac Newton didn't miss much,
            but that one was a beaut.

            He just walked right past
            the door to a hidden universe;

            a door that would not swing open
            again for another 150 years.

            It would fall
            on another scientist,

            working in the year 1800,

            to stumble
            on a piece of evidence

            for the unseen worlds
            that surround us.

            By night, William Herschel
            scanned the heavens

            with the largest telescope
            of his time.

            By day, Herschel performed
            experiments.

            From Newton's earlier work,
            it was known that sunlight

            is a blend of different colors.

            And everyone knew,
            just from being outside,

            that sunlight carries heat.

            William Herschel asked

            whether some colors of light
            carry more heat than others.

            The nature of scientific genius
            is to question

            what the rest of us
            take for granted...

            and then do the experiment.

            The thermometer that Herschel
            placed outside the spectrum

            was his control.

            The control in any experiment

            always lacks
            the factor being tested.

            That way, you know
            if what you're testing is

            really the thing responsible
            for the observation.

            In Herschel's experiment,

            the relationship between

            color and temperature
            was being tested,

            and so his control was
            a thermometer

            over the part
            of the white sheet

            that was not illuminated
            by sunlight at all.

            There's that sound again.

            What is that?

            Okay, red light is warmer
            than blue light.

            Interesting discovery,
            but not exactly revolutionary.

            No, there's nothing wrong
            with your thermometer.

            You've just discovered
            a new kind of light.

            Herschel was the first
            to detect this unseen presence

            lurking just below
            the red end of the spectrum.

            That's why it came
            to be called "infrared."

            "Infra" is Latin
            for the word "below."

            It's invisible.

            Our eyes are not sensitive
            to this kind of light,

            but our skin is--
            we feel it as heat.

            Now, that's
            a really big discovery.

            But far greater secrets
            were still hiding

            deep inside the light.

            At about the
            same time that William Herschel

            was discovering infrared light
            in his parlor in England,

            a young boy named
            Joseph Fraunhofer

            was trapped
            in hopeless drudgery.

            He stood over a cauldron
            of toxic chemicals

            and endlessly stirred.

            Joseph had been orphaned
            at the age of 11

            and given to a harsh master
            named Weichselberger,

            the royal mirror-maker.

            He prevented Joseph
            from going to school.

            Instead, Joseph labored in

            the glass-making
            workshop by day,

            and tended to the master's
            household chores by night.

            Hurry up, stupid!

            And remember, no reading.

            Until Joseph got his big break.

            Weichselberger's
            house collapsed.

            Maximilian, the future
            king of Bavaria,

            hurried to the scene
            of the calamity

            to see if he could help.

            Maximilian was known for

            taking an interest
            in his subjects,

            which was highly unusual
            for its time.

            In attracting the concern
            of the future king of Bavaria,

            young Joseph Fraunhofer

            found an aperture into
            a different universe.

            And not just for himself.

            Prince Maximilian
            gave Joseph money

            and asked his privy councilor

            to provide further
            help to the boy,

            should it be needed.

            Weichselberger continued
            to exploit him

            and prevent him
            from attending school.

            But the prince's councilor
            intervened,

            offering Joseph a position
            at the Optical Institute.

            This small gesture of kindness
            really paid off.

            By the time he was 27,

            Joseph Fraunhofer was
            the world's leading designer

            of high-quality lenses,

            telescopes and other
            optical instruments.

            His firm was housed here,
            in the old Benediktbeuren Abbey.

            In the early 19th century,

            this was top-secret,
            ultra-high technology.

            The Benedictine monks
            of earlier times

            had taken a vow of secrecy.

            This local tradition,

            and the ability
            to restrict access

            to Fraunhofer's laboratory,

            allowed him to maintain control

            of trade and state secrets.

            Fraunhofer was experimenting
            with prisms

            to find the best types of glass
            for precision lenses.

            How, he wondered,
            could he get a better look

            at the spectrum that
            a prism produced?

            Friedrich, bring me
            the theodolite, please.

            Okay, while Fraunhofer
            sets up his theodolite--

            it's a kind of telescope--

            I want to show you something
            in another part of the abbey.

            Sound waves are
            so beautiful to hear.

            Imagine how beautiful
            they'd be to see.

            You ever wondered why organ
            pipes have different lengths?

            I press a key...

            it sends compressed air

            into a particular pipe,

            producing sound waves.

            If we could slow the sound waves
            down a few hundred times,

            they would look like this.

            The length of the pipe

            determines the length
            of the sound wave

            that can fit inside it.

            A short pipe gives you
            a short sound wave.

            Short sounds waves have
            high pitch, or frequency.

            Let's stop the waves
            for a better look.

            The distance between
            adjacent waves

            is called the wavelength.

            A long pipe gives you
            a long sound wave

            with a low pitch,
            or low frequency.

            The medieval manuscript of
            this music, "Carmina Burana,"

            was discovered
            in this very abbey.

            Sound waves can't travel
            through a vacuum.

            They need matter to ride on,

            like molecules of air,
            or water, or rock.

            But light waves fly solo.

            They can move
            through empty space.

            And fast--

            a million times faster
            than sound waves in air.

            And the wavelengths
            of the light we see

            are so much shorter
            than sound waves.

            About 50,000 light waves

            would fit right in here.

            Oh, yeah.

            Fraunhofer.

            Just in time.

            We didn't miss it.

            Just as the wavelength of sound

            determines the pitch
            that we hear,

            the wavelength of light

            determines the color
            that we see.

            But how does a prism
            spread out the colors

            concealed in
            a beam of sunlight?

            When light travels
            through air or space,

            all its colors move
            at the same speed.

            But when it hits glass
            at an angle,

            the light slows down
            and changes direction.

            Inside the prism,

            each color moves
            at a different speed.

            In glass, violet light,

            which is carried by
            the shortest waves we see,

            slows down more than red light,

            which has the longest waves.

            These changes in speed

            pry the colors apart,

            sending their waves off

            in slightly different
            directions.

            That's how a prism works.

            If I seem unduly
            emotional about this,

            it's because Joseph Fraunhofer
            is about to do

            what Isaac Newton
            could've done, but didn't.

            And it'll have a powerful effect

            on the course of my own life.

            You are witnessing the marriage

            of physics and astronomy,

            the birth of my own
            field of science,

            astrophysics.

            Written in the light,

            in those vertical black lines...

            is secret code.

            Fraunhofer looked at them,
            and wondered...

            Why?

            A code that comes to us

            from an alien universe.

            What is the message

            written in these dark,
            vertical lines?

            It took a hundred years
            of thinking,

            questioning, searching
            to decipher it.

            Lovely, isn't it?

            Why?

            There are many layers to
            the fine structure of beauty...

            the chemistry of the Earth
            and its atmosphere...

            the evolution of life...

            Many distinct threads.

            Let's just examine one,
            at the surface...

            the colors of nature
            that dazzle us.

            What's really happening?

            How does the red, the blue...

            the astonishing palette
            of nature's colors...

            how do they happen?

            Light waves of different lengths
            from the Sun

            strike the Earth.

            The petals of these
            particular flowers

            absorb all the low-energy,

            long red wavelengths of light.

            But the petals reflect

            the shorter, high-energy
            blue wavelengths.

            That interaction
            between starlight and petal--

            or water, or Van Gogh--

            is what makes blue.

            The longest waves,

            the ones we see as red,

            have the lowest energy.

            Color is the way
            our eyes perceive

            how energetic light waves are.

            A sunset...

            a flag...

            the eyes of your beloved...

            that shiny new car.

            The feelings they inspire

            happen when something inside you

            is triggered by
            a particular variation

            in the frequency and
            energy of light waves.

            And the secret message?

            Those black vertical lines

            in Fraunhofer's spectrum?

            What makes them?

            They occur when the light waves

            of those particular colors
            are being absorbed.

            It happens on another level
            of reality,

            far smaller than the world
            we're used to operating in.

            To get there,
            we'll need to become

            ten billion times smaller
            than we are.

            We could pick
            any one of these atoms.

            But let's go
            for the hydrogen atom.

            The hydrogen atom is
            the most plentiful kind

            of atom in the cosmos.

            And the simplest.

            It has only one electron.

            And only one proton.

            We've entered
            the quantum realm.

            It doesn't correspond

            to ordinary human experience.

            Common sense is
            no help here at all.

            Take the hydrogen atom's
            electron, for example.

            In an atom, an electron

            doesn't exist between orbitals.

            It disappears from one orbital

            and reappears in another.

            It's as if you took an elevator
            from the second floor

            to the fourth floor,
            but ceased to exist in between.

            And another thing.

            Quantum elevators only stop
            at certain floors.

            The sizes of the electron
            orbits are strictly limited,

            and different
            for the atoms of every element.

            That's why the elements
            are different.

            The chemistry
            of anything is determined

            by its electron orbits.

            The force that holds
            an electron in orbit

            has nothing to do with gravity.

            It's a force
            of electrical attraction.

            The electron dances a wavy ring

            around the central nucleus
            of a hydrogen atom.

            And makes quantum leaps
            from orbit to orbit.

            Up or down.

            The larger the orbit,

            the greater the energy
            of an electron.

            An electron has

            to get energy to leap
            to a larger orbit.

            And it has to lose energy
            to jump back down.

            Every upward leap
            is caused by...

            an atom absorbing a light wave.

            But we have no idea what causes
            the downward leaps.

            What we do know that such leaps
            always produce a light wave

            whose color matches
            the energy difference

            between the orbitals.

            The Sun's surface radiates
            light waves of all colors.

            If you look at sunlight
            through a prism,

            you'll see its spectrum.

            When you magnify the spectrum
            with a telescope,

            as Joseph Fraunhofer did,

            you raise the curtain

            on the electron dance
            within the atom.

            When the energy
            of the electron flags,

            and it drops
            to a lower orbital,

            the light wave
            it emits scatters.

            Most of it doesn't reach us.

            That leaves a dark gap

            or black vertical line
            in the spectrum.

            These dark lines
            are the shadows

            cast by hydrogen atoms

            in the atmosphere of the Sun.

            Sodium atoms cast
            different shadows.

            Their electrons dance
            to a different tune.

            A grain of table salt
            is composed

            of sodium and chlorine atoms.

            Ten million billion of them

            doing their crazy dances

            in a single grain of salt.

            And a single iron atom
            with 26 electrons

            is like a great
            big production number

            in a Broadway musical.

            When you look at a star
            with a spectroscope,

            you see the dark lines
            from all the elements

            in its atmosphere.

            Show me the spectrum
            of anything,

            whether here on Earth
            or from a distant star,

            and I'll tell you
            what it's made of.

            Fraunhofer's lines are
            the atomic signatures

            of the elements writ large
            across the cosmos.

            As with every
            other major revelation

            in the history of science,
            it opened the way

            to newer and deeper mysteries.

            And to the revelation
            that there were

            many more secrets
            hiding in the light.

            When Joseph Fraunhofer combined
            a prism with a telescope

            and turned it toward the skies,

            he brought the stars
            much closer to us.

            When he was only 39,

            he contracted a fatal illness.

            Perhaps as a result of his
            early and long-term exposure

            to the toxic chemicals
            of glassmaking.

            You never know where
            the next genius will come from.

            How many of them do we leave
            in the rubble?

            The prince and his kingdom
            were immeasurably enriched

            by that act of kindness
            to a poor orphan.

            Fraunhofer's discoveries
            transformed Bavaria

            from a rural backwater
            to a technological powerhouse.

            As he lay dying,
            the government was desperate

            to preserve every shred
            of his precious knowledge

            about the high technology
            of optical glass.

            But it could only be divulged
            to a person

            with top security clearance--

            the director of the mint.

            The government kept
            Fraunhofer's technology

            for making perfect
            optical glass

            a State secret
            for another hundred years.

            This would prove
            to be a major obstacle

            for someone we'll meet later
            in our journey.

            But Fraunhofer would allow
            no such secrecy

            where his pure scientific
            research was concerned.

            He knew that science requires
            openness to flourish;

            that our understanding of nature
            belongs to the world.

            As soon as Fraunhofer discovered
            the spectral lines,

            he published everything
            he knew about them.

            And the reverberations
            of his momentous discovery

            echo still.

            His spectral lines revealed
            that the visible cosmos

            is all made
            of the same elements.

            The planets...

            The stars...

            The galaxies...

            We, ourselves,
            and all of life...

            The same star stuff.

            He made it possible
            for us to know

            what's in the atmosphere
            of other worlds.

            And in galaxies millions
            of light-years away.

            Spectral lines revealed
            not only the composition

            of far-off objects,
            but also their motion

            towards or away from us.

            Using them, we discovered
            that our universe is expanding.

            But perhaps the greatest
            revelation of spectroscopy

            is the discovery
            of the thing it cannot see.

            A hidden universe
            of dark matter

            six times more massive
            than the familiar cosmos.

            It's made
            of some mysterious substance

            that does not emit, reflect
            or absorb any kind of light.

            We only know it's there
            because of its gravity,

            which pulls on all the galaxies

            and speeds up
            the visible stars within them.

            There are many more kinds of
            light than our eyes can see.

            Confining our perception
            of nature to visible light

            is like listening to music

            in only one octave.

            There are so many more.

            They differ only in wavelength,

            but over a huge range.

            For instance, infrared light...

            the kind that
            William Herschel discovered

            Or X-ray light.

            Or radio light.

            Or in gamma-ray light.

            These are not just different
            ways of seeing the same thing.

            These other kinds of light

            reveal different objects
            and phenomena in the cosmos.

            In gamma-ray light, for example,
            we can see mysterious explosions

            in distant galaxies

            that we would otherwise miss.

            And in microwave light,
            we can see all the way back

            to the birth of the universe.

            We have only
            just opened our eyes.

            Imagine that we are
            travelers from the stars...

            ...bound for the sun.

            We would discover it surrounded
            by four giant, cloudy, gas worlds:

            Blue Neptune and its
            frozen moon, Triton.

            And then farther in,
            Uranus and its dark rings...

            ...made perhaps of organic matter.

            Saturn, the jewel of the solar system...

            ...set within concentric rings...

            ...composed of a billion icy moons.

            And finally, flanked
            by massive satellites...

            ...the largest planet, Jupiter.



            Its multicolored clouds...

            ...studded with flashes of lightning.

            Still farther in...

            ...closer to the sun...

            ...there are no more giant planets...

            ...only a host of lesser worlds...

            ...made of rock and metal...

            ...some with a thin envelope of air.

            They huddle about the sun...

            ...with almost no internal
            heat of their own...

            ...tiny places with solid surfaces...

            ...one of which is a
            blue and pretty world...

            ...called Earth.

            Half-covered with clouds...



            ...it is the home planet of travelers...

            ...who have just learned
            to sail the sea of space...

            ...to investigate close-up...

            ...Jupiter, Saturn,
            Uranus and Neptune...

            ...its brothers and sisters
            in the family of the sun.

            Human voyages of exploration
            to the outer solar system...

            ...are controlled, so far, from a
            single place on the planet Earth...

            ...the Jet Propulsion Laboratory...

            ...of the National Aeronautics
            and Space Administration...

            ...in Pasadena, California.

            Here on Sunday, July 8th, 1979...

            ...the Voyager 2 spacecraft...

            ...began its close passage
            by Jupiter and its moons.

            General science systems...

            JPL MAN: ...are you
            ready with status check?

            Yes, I am.

            SAGAN: The spacecraft
            had been instructed...

            ...how to explore the Jupiter system...

            ...by a sequence of
            commands radioed earlier...

            ...to its onboard computers.

            Power, 450 watts.

            Power is go at this time.

            DSE systems.

            LACP mode is far and counter.

            We are at take 210.

            Direction last recorded was
            reversed, and the track is track one.

            Here we check how faithful
            an emissary Voyager is.

            Does it understand the commands?

            How is its health, its temperature...

            ...its brains...

            ...its heart?

            Yes, detailed science is coming up...

            "A" systems...

            ...completed the status check...

            ...and the spacecraft is go.

            Roger. Thank you.

            SAGAN: The modern ships that
            sail to the planets are unmanned.

            They are beautifully constructed...

            ...semi-intelligent robots.

            Voyager's eyes are two
            television cameras...

            ...designed to take tens of thousands
            of pictures in the outer solar system.

            Along with other instruments, they
            are mounted on a scan platform...

            ...which points at passing planets.

            Voyager's brains are three
            integrated computers set amidships.

            It communicates with Earth
            through a large radio antenna...

            ...mounted like a sail.

            Voyager bears a message for
            any alien civilization...

            ...it may one day encounter
            in interstellar space.

            Its louvers open and shut to help
            control the onboard temperature.

            But Voyager cruises
            so far from the sun...

            ...that it cannot depend on solar power.

            Instead, it has a small
            nuclear power plant...

            ...quarantined from
            the rest of the ship.

            Many things can go wrong
            in such pioneering missions.

            So people are a little uneasy...

            ...at Voyager mission control.

            Jupiter is surrounded by a shell of
            invisible but extremely dangerous...

            ...high-energy charged particles.

            If Voyager flies too close...

            ...its delicate
            electronics will be fried.

            A collision with a small boulder
            in the rings of Jupiter...

            ...could send the spacecraft
            tumbling wildly out of control...

            ...its antenna unable to find
            the Earth, its data lost forever.

            Voyager 1 and Voyager 2...

            ...were launched a month
            apart in late summer of 1977.

            After many alarms and close calls...

            ...they successfully arrived months
            apart at the Jupiter system...

            ...where they worked brilliantly...

            ...providing the first close-up
            views of mighty Jupiter...

            ...and its four large
            and mysterious moons:

            Io, the innermost of the four...

            ...Europa...

            ...and moving away from Jupiter...

            ...Ganymede...

            ...and the outermost big moon...

            ...Callisto.

            In a mission that
            costs a penny a world...

            ...for every human on the planet Earth.

            Voyager's passage by Jupiter...

            ...accelerated it in a close
            encounter with the planet Saturn.

            Saturn's gravity will
            propel it on to Uranus...

            ...and in this game of cosmic
            billiards, after Uranus...

            ...it will plunge on past Neptune,
            leaving the solar system...

            ...and becoming an
            interstellar spacecraft...

            ...destined to wander forever...

            ...the great ocean between the stars.

            And if Voyager should, sometime
            in its distant future...

            ...encounter beings from some
            other civilization in space...

            ...it bears a message.

            A phonograph record. Golden, delicate...

            ...with instruction for use.

            And on this record are a sampling
            of pictures, sounds, greetings...

            ...and an hour and a
            half of exquisite music...

            ...the Earth's greatest hits.

            A gift across the cosmic ocean...

            ...from one island of
            civilization to another.

            The record bears in English...

            ...an additional handwritten
            greeting that says:

            "To the makers of music,
            all worlds, all times."

            These voyages of
            exploration and discovery...

            ...are the latest in a long
            series which have characterized...

            ...and distinguished the human species.

            In the 15th and 16th centuries...

            ...you could travel from Spain
            to the Azores in a few days.

            The same time it takes now to
            cross that little channel...

            ...from the Earth to the moon.

            It took, then, a few months to
            traverse the Atlantic Ocean...

            ...and reach what was
            called the "New World"...

            ...the Americas.

            Today it takes a few months to cross
            the ocean of the inner solar system...

            ...and reach Mars and Venus,
            wich are truly and literally...

            ...new worlds awaiting us.

            In the 17th and 18th centuries...

            ...you could travel from Holland
            to China, say, in a year or two...

            ...the same time it
            takes now for Voyager...

            ...to travel from the Earth to Jupiter.

            And in comparison to the
            resources of the society...

            ...it cost more then to send
            sailing ships to the Far East...

            ...than it does now to send
            spaceships to the planets.

            The passion to explore...

            ...is at the heart of being human.

            This impulse to go, to see, to know...

            ...has found expression
            in every culture.

            Africa was circumnavigated
            by Phoenician sailors...

            ...in the employ of
            an Egyptian pharaoh...

            ...in the 7th century B.C.

            The islands of the
            Pacific were settled...

            ...by skilled and heroic
            navigators from Indonesia.

            Great fleets of ocean-going junks...

            ...left the ports of
            Ming Dynasty China...

            ...to explore India and Africa.

            A century later, three
            ships left Spain...

            ...under the command of
            an Italian navigator...

            ...to discover the Americas.

            And then a Portuguese
            expedition succeeded...

            ...in sailing all the way
            around this blue globe.

            These voyagers of many cultures...

            ...were the first planetary explorers.

            They have bound the
            Earth up into one world.

            In our exploration of other worlds...

            ...we follow in their footsteps.

            Our present spaceships
            are the harbingers...

            ...the vanguard of future human
            expeditions to the planets.

            We have traveled this way before...

            ...and there is much to be learned...

            ...by studying those great
            voyages of a few centuries ago.

            In the 17th century...

            ...the citizens of the
            new Dutch Republic...

            ...pursued a course of
            vigorous planetary exploration.

            Holland was then a
            revolutionary society.

            It had just declared its
            independence from the powerful...

            ...but stagnant Spanish empire...

            ...and with a newfound
            self-confidence...

            ...Holland embraced, more fully
            than any other nation of its time...

            ...the spirit of the
            European Enlightment.

            It was a rational, orderly
            and creative society.

            But because Spanish ports and
            vessels were closed to the Dutch...

            ...the economic survival
            of the tiny republic...

            ...depended on its ability to
            construct, man and operate...

            ...a great fleet of
            commercial sailing vessels.

            The Dutch East India Company...

            ...was a combined governmental
            and commercial enterprise...

            ...which sent shipping to the
            far corners of the world...

            ...to acquire rare commodities and
            resell them at a profit in Europe.

            Such voyages were the
            life's blood of the republic.

            Navigational charts and maps
            were classified as state secrets.

            Ships sometimes left with
            sealed sailing orders...

            ...the crews embarking for
            an unknown destination...

            ...more than a year away on
            the far side of the planet.

            These expeditions were not
            only commercial exploitations...

            ...although there was
            certainly plenty of that.

            Beside the usual appeals
            of ambition, greed...

            ...national pride and the
            thirst for adventure...

            ...the Dutch were also motivated by
            a powerful scientific curiosity...

            ...and a fascination
            with all things new.

            New lands, new peoples...

            ...new plants and animals.

            This building, then the
            Amsterdam town hall...

            ...still attests to the
            hardy self-assurance...

            ...of its 17th-century architects.

            Its lavish crystal
            adornments still reflect...

            ...the glittering pride they
            felt in their accomplishments...

            ...and their prosperity.

            It took shiploads of
            marble to build this place.

            Constantin Huygens, a poet
            and diplomat of the time...

            ...said that this town hall
            dispelled what he called...

            ..."the Gothic squint and squalor."

            The Middle Ages had ended,
            the Enlightment had begun.

            Up there, do you see...

            ...is Atlas supporting the
            heavens on his shoulders.

            And beneath...

            ...is Justice with a golden sword...

            ...and golden scales flanked...

            ...by Death and Punishment.

            And who is it that Justice
            is trampling underfoot?

            Why, it's Avarice and Envy...

            ...the gods of the merchants.

            The Dutch knew that the
            unrestrained pursuit of profit...

            ...posed serious threats
            to the soul of the nation.

            A less allegorical symbol...

            ...is down here, on the floor.

            It is a great inlaid map...

            ...stretching from West
            Africa to the Pacific Ocean.

            The whole world was
            then Holland's arena.

            In a typical year,
            many sailing vessels...

            ...set out halfway around
            the world for the Far East...

            ...on voyages of exploration
            and discovery, of trade...

            ...journeys taking years to accomplish.

            Down the west coast of Africa, through
            what they called the Ethiopian sea...

            ...skirting the southern
            coast of Africa...

            ...through the Straits of Madagascar...

            ...and on past the
            southern tip of India...

            ...to the Spice Islands
            and present-day Indonesia.

            Another set of voyagers went
            south then east, to New Holland...

            ...later renamed Australia.

            And still other journeys ventured
            through the Straits of Malacca...

            ...to the Empire of China.

            But Holland was a small country
            forced to live by its wits.

            There was a strong pacifist
            element in its foreign policy.

            Never before or since has
            Holland boasted such a galaxy...

            ...of scientists, mathematicians,
            philosophers and artists.

            This was the time of the
            great painters, Rembrandt...

            ...and Vermeer.

            Because Holland was tolerant
            of unorthodox opinions...

            ...it was a refuge for intellectuals...

            ...fleeing the thought control and
            censorship of other parts of Europe...

            ...much as the United States
            benefited enormously in the 1930s...

            ...from the exodus of intellectuals...

            ...from Nazi-dominated Europe.

            And so it was that
            17th-century Holland...

            ...was the home of the great
            Jewish philosopher Spinoza...

            ...who Einstein admired so much...

            ...of Ren? Descartes,
            a pivotal figure...

            ...in the history of
            philosophy and of mathematics...

            ...and the home of a political
            scientist named John Locke...

            ...who was to have a powerful...

            ...and profound influence...

            ...on a group of philosophically
            inclined revolutionaries...

            ...named Paine, Hamilton, Adams...

            ...Franklin and Jefferson.

            The Dutch University of Leyden...

            ...offered a professorship to an
            Italian scientist named Galileo...

            ...who had been forced
            by the Catholic Church...

            ...under threat of torture...

            ...to recant the heretical position...

            ...that the Earth went around
            the sun and not vice versa.

            Galileo had close ties with Holland.

            His first astronomical
            telescope was based...

            ...on a spyglass of Dutch manufacture.

            And with it, he discovered
            the craters of the moon...

            ...the phases of Venus and the
            four large moons of Jupiter.

            Becoming an exploratory power...

            ...made Holland a vital intellectual
            and cultural center as well.

            The improvement of sailing technology
            spurred technology in general.

            A key problem in navigation was
            the determination of longitude.

            Latitude could be determined easily...

            ...the farther south, the more
            southern constellations you could see.

            But longitude required
            precise timekeeping.

            An accurate shipboard clock...

            ...would continue to keep
            time in your home port.

            The rising and setting of stars
            would give you the local time...

            ...and the difference between the two...

            ...would tell you how far
            east or west you had gone.

            Technological advance
            required the freest...

            ...possible pursuit of knowledge.

            So Holland became the leading
            publisher and bookseller in Europe...

            ...translating works
            written in other languages...

            ...and printing books that
            had been censored elsewhere.

            Adventures into exotic lands...

            ...and encounters with
            strange societies...

            ...shook complacency.

            They challenged the prevailing wisdom...

            ...and showed that ideas which has
            been accepted for thousands of years...

            ...might be fundamentally in error.

            In a time when kings and emperors
            ruled much of the planet...

            ...the Dutch Republic was governed,
            more than any other world power...

            ...by the people.

            They enjoyed a certain
            material well-being.

            But the interiors of their houses...

            ...celebrated by a generation
            of Dutch painters...

            ...suggest restraint and discretion.

            The officers of these ships
            of exploration and trade...

            ...would return from
            their long voyages...

            ...share in the goods
            they had acquired...

            ...and discuss the wonders
            they had encountered.

            Holland prospered in
            its freedom of thought.

            In Italy, Galileo had
            announced other worlds.

            Giordano Bruno had speculated
            on intelligent life elsewhere.

            For this they were
            made to suffer brutally.

            But in Holland, the astronomer
            Christiaan Huygens...

            ...who strongly supported both
            ideas, was showered with honors.

            Christiaan was the son
            of Constantin Huygens.

            The elder Huygens
            distinguished himself...

            ...as a master diplomat of
            the age, a man of letters...

            ...a close friend and translator
            of the English poet, John Donne.

            Constantin Huygens was also an
            accomplished composer and musician.

            It was Constantin who had
            discovered a young painter...

            ...named Rembrandt van Rijn...

            ...in several of whose works
            he subsequently appears.

            He opened the doors of his house...

            ...to artists, musicians, writers...

            ...statesmen and scientists.

            A feast of goods and ideas...

            ...from all over the world awaited them.

            The philosopher Descartes,
            who visited him here...

            ...said of Constantin Huygens...

            ..."I could not believe
            that a single mind...

            ...could occupy itself
            with so many things...

            ...and acquit itself
            so well in all of them."

            He even excelled at
            the art of parenthood.

            He was a tender and loving father.

            His son, Christiaan, flourished
            in this rich environment...

            ...demonstrating extraordinary
            talents for languages, drawing...

            ...law, science, engineering,
            mathematics and music.

            "The world is my country," he said...

            ..."science my religion."

            Light was the motif of the age...

            ...the symbolic enlightenment of
            freedom of thought and religion...

            ...the light that suffused
            the paintings of the time...

            ...and light as an object
            of scientific study.

            The microscope was invented
            in Holland at this time...

            ...and became a drawing-room curiosity.

            Its inventor was a friend
            of Christiaan Huygens...

            ...a man named Anton Leeuwenhoek.

            The first microscopes
            were developed from...

            ...magnifying glasses used by drapers...

            ...to examine the quality of cloth.

            Leeuwenhoek and Huygens...

            ...are the grandfathers
            of much of modern medicine.

            Because, to his amazement...

            ...Leeuwenhoek discovered a universe...

            ...in a drop of water:

            The microbes, which he
            described as "animalcules"...

            ...and thought "cute."

            Leeuwenhoek and Huygens...

            ...were among the first people
            to see human sperm cells...

            ...a hitherto hidden microcosm
            of the human life cycle.

            Leeuwenhoek had discovered
            the microbial world.

            Huygens had argued from his
            telescopic observations...

            ...that Mars was another world...

            ...and probably, an inhabited one.

            What a waste of a planet, he thought...

            ...if Mars were barren.

            So the Viking search
            for microbes on Mars...

            ...can be traced directly back
            to Huygens and Leeuwenhoek...

            ...in 17th-century Holland.

            The telescope and the
            microscope developed here...

            ...represent an extension
            of human vision...

            ...to the realms of the very small...

            ...and the very large.

            Our observations of
            atoms and galaxies...

            ...were launched in this time and place.

            From the bending of
            light through a lens...

            ...Huygens advanced the idea...

            ...that light was a kind of wave.

            He ground and polished lenses...

            ...for the successively larger
            telescopes he constructed...

            ...although it did take
            him a time to figure out...

            ...how to use them properly.

            Huygens was the first person
            to see a surface feature...

            ...on the planet Mars.

            He was the first person to speculate...

            ...that Venus is completely
            covered with clouds.

            He was the first person to understand
            the nature of the rings of Saturn.

            "Saturn is surrounded," he wrote...

            ..."by a thin, flat ring...

            ...which nowhere touches
            the body of the planet."

            His discoveries with the telescope...

            ...who by themselves
            have ensured his place...

            ...in the history of
            human accomplishment.

            Huygens was the discoverer of Titan...

            ...the largest moon of Saturn.

            The immense size and changing
            clouds of Jupiter entranced him.

            Astronomers, as well as navigators...

            ...need accurate clocks to time
            the movement of the heavens.

            Huygens was the inventor of
            many precision timepieces...

            ...including the pendulum clock.

            To illustrate the sun-centered
            universe of Copernicus...

            ...he built computers that reproduced
            the clockwork of the heavens...

            ...from Mercury to Saturn.

            The machines he designed, he signed...

            ..."Christiaan Huygens, inventor."

            He was delighted that
            the Copernican system...

            ...was widely accepted in
            everyday life in Holland...

            ...and acknowledged by astronomers,
            except those, he wrote...

            ...who "were a bit slow-witted
            or under the superstitions...

            ...imposed by merely human authority.

            Across the sea of space...

            ...the stars...

            ...are other suns."

            A point which Huygens
            appreciated perfectly well.

            He reasoned that if
            our planetary system...

            ...involved the sun and
            planets going around it...

            ...that those other suns should
            likewise have a retinue...

            ...of planets going around them...

            ...and also that many of the
            other planets were inhabited.

            He set forth these conclusions...

            ...in a remarkable book...

            ...bearing the triumphant title...

            ...The Celestial Worlds Discovered.

            The subtitle is...

            ..."Conjectures Concerning...

            ...the Inhabitants,
            Plants and Productions...

            ...of the Worlds in the Planets."

            He wrote this book sometime
            shortly before his death...

            ...in the year 1690, in this study.

            By and large...

            ...he imagined that the
            environments of the other planets...

            ...and also the inhabitants
            of the other planets...

            ...were pretty much like
            those of 17th-century Europe.

            I wonder if he imagined...

            ...traveling to those other
            worlds which he had been...

            ...the first to examine close-up...

            ...through the telescope.

            Perhaps he dreamt that voyages
            of discovery to the planets...

            ...would one day be like the
            voyages of geographical discovery...

            ...in his time and place.

            He did imagine of
            extraterrestrial beings...

            ..."that their whole bodies,
            and every part of them...

            ...may be quite distinct
            and different from ours.

            'Its a very ridiculous
            opinion," he says...

            ..."that it is impossible
            a rational soul...

            ...should dwell in any
            other shape than ours."

            You could be smart,
            Huygens was saying...

            ...even if you looked funny.

            But he then went on to argue...

            ...that they didn't
            look all that funny...

            ...that extraterrestrial
            beings must have...

            ...hands and feet and stand upright...

            ...and have writing and geometry.

            Even that the four moons of Jupiter...

            ...the Galilean satellites,
            were there in order to provide...

            ...a navigational aid, a convenience...

            ...for the sailors in the Jovian oceans.

            Well, maybe.

            (WOOD CREAKS)

            That bit of speculation
            is probably wrong, but...

            ...think of a citizen
            of the 17th century...

            ...with the courage and insight...

            ...to imagine other landscapes
            and other intelligences.

            Might there really be mariners...

            ...on a million other worlds?

            In his book, Huygens wrote:

            "What a wonderful and
            amazing scheme have we here...

            ...of the magnificent
            vastness of the universe.

            So many suns. So many earths.

            And every one of them
            stocked with so many animals.

            Adorned with so many seas.

            How must our wonder and
            admiration be increased...

            ...when we consider the prodigious
            distance and multitude...

            ...of the stars?"

            The Dutch called their
            ships "flying boats"...

            ...and the Voyager spacecraft
            are their descendants...

            ...true flying boats...

            ...bound for the
            stars, and on the way...

            ...exploring some of those
            worlds which Christiaan Huygens...

            ...a man from Earth...

            ...knew and loved so well.

            Travelers' tales:

            A main commodity...

            ...returned by those sailing
            ship voyages of centuries ago...

            ...were stories.

            Stories of alien lands
            and exotic creatures.

            They evoked a sense of wonder and
            stimulated further exploration.

            Those tales of strange worlds...

            ...enabled some Europeans
            to see themselves anew.

            There had been accounts of
            headless people, foot people...

            ...cyclops people.

            Now the Dutch brought
            back fantastic stories...

            ...of giant hunters...

            ...dodoes...

            ...rhinos...

            ...leopards...

            ...and other creatures.

            Modern voyagers also
            return travelers' tales:

            Tales of a world shattered
            like a crystal sphere.

            A place where the ground is covered...

            ...with what looks like
            a network of giant cobwebs.

            A world with an underground ocean.

            Tiny moons shaped like potatoes.

            A yellow and red pockmarked land...

            ...with lakes of molten sulfur...

            ...and volcanic eruptions
            300 kilometers high.

            And a place called Jupiter...

            ...so large that a thousand
            Earths would fit inside.

            There are no mountains, valleys,
            volcanoes or rivers there.

            Just a vast ocean of gas and clouds.

            Everything we see on Jupiter
            is floating in the sky.

            But there's much that is
            fascinating about Jupiter.

            As the solar system condensed out
            of interstellar gas and dust...

            ...Jupiter acquired most of the matter
            not ejected into interstellar space...

            ...and which didn't fall
            inwards to form the sun.

            Jupiter is made mostly of hydrogen
            and helium, just like the sun...

            ...and had Jupiter been a few
            dozen times more massive...

            ...the matter in it...

            ...might have undergone thermonuclear
            reactions in the interior...

            ...and Jupiter would have
            begun to shine by its own light.

            Jupiter is a star that failed.

            Had it become a star...

            ...we would be living in
            a double-star system...

            ...with two suns in our sky...

            ...and the nights
            would come more rarely.

            Deep below the clouds of Jupiter, the weights
            of the underlying layers of atmosphere...

            ...produce pressures
            which are much greater...

            ...than any that are found
            anywhere on the Earth.

            The clouds are this layer here.

            The deep interior is
            this high-pressure place.

            The pressure is so large...

            ...that electrons are squeezed
            off hydrogen atoms, producing...

            ...liquid metallic hydrogen.

            But at the very core of
            Jupiter, there may be a lump...

            ...of rock and iron...

            ...a giant Earth-like world
            under astonishing pressures...

            ...hidden forever at the
            center of the largest planet.

            Just before Voyager...

            ...encountered Jupiter, you could
            see that giant planet at night...

            ...shining in the sky as our ancestors
            have for the last million years.

            And on my way to study
            the Voyager data...

            ...arriving at the Jet
            Propulsion Laboratory...

            ...I thought that Jupiter
            would never be the same again.

            Never again just a point
            of light in the night sky...

            ...but forever after, a place
            to be explored and known.

            To see the first close-up images
            of a world never before known...

            ...this moment is one of a greatest joys
            in the life of a planetary scientist.

            In the early morning hours of
            July 9th, 1979, on the real-time...

            ...television monitors at the
            Jet Propulsion Laboratory...

            ...we began to learn about
            a world called Europa.

            These are the modern explorers.

            Men and women trained...

            ...in astronomy, physics,
            geology or engineering.

            Many devoting five to eight
            years to this single mission.

            JPL MAN: Cassen's model for Europa
            says if you start with a liquid...

            ...you can put in enough
            energy to keep it liquid.

            But Cassen said in order for there
            to be enough heating going on...

            ...you had to start the heating
            before Europa basically cooled off.

            But what about relief from the cracks?

            ...and Europa there's
            a twin, a pair there...

            You can't look at a world
            so different from ours...

            ...without wondering how both were made.

            Just rotate it out a little bit.

            Voyager presented us with six new
            worlds in the Jupiter system alone.

            The more you learn about other worlds,
            the better you understand our own.

            We speculate, criticize, argue,
            calculate, reflect and wonder.

            We return again to the
            astonishing data, and slowly...

            ...we begin to understand.

            The Dutch sailing ships brought
            back rare and valuable commodities...

            ...from the new worlds they visited.

            Our Voyager spaceships...

            ...return rare and
            valuable information...

            ...to computerized wharves on
            this shore of the sea of space.

            Here the data are allowed to be stored,
            enhanced, processed and treasured.

            Maps of alien lands will be
            generated from this information.

            In this electronic warehouse are
            tens of thousands of images...

            ...of previously unknown worlds.

            How does a picture from the
            outer solar system get to us?

            Sunlight shines on Europa, and
            is reflected back to space...

            ...where some strikes the phosphors...

            ...of the Voyager television
            cameras, generating an image.

            The image is radioed back
            across the immense distance...

            ...of half a billion kilometers...

            ...to a radio telescope on
            Earth. One in Australia, say.

            The telescope then
            passes the information...

            ...via communications
            satellite in Earth orbit...

            ...to Southern California.

            There, it's transmitted by a
            set of microwave relay towers...

            ...to a computer at the
            Jet Propulsion Laboratory...

            ...and there it is processed.

            The picture is like a
            newspaper wire photo...

            ...made of perhaps a million individual
            dots of differing shades of gray...

            ...so fine and close
            together that at a distance...

            ...the constituent dots are invisible.

            We see only their cumulative effect.

            The information for the spacecraft
            specifies how bright or dark...

            ...each dot is to be.

            After processing, the dots are
            stored on a magnetic disk...

            ...something like a phonograph record.

            By this day, there were already 11,000
            pictures from Voyager 2 in our...

            ...electronic library.

            Finally, the end product
            of this remarkable set...

            ...of links and relays...

            ...is a hard copy which comes
            out of this machine showing...

            ...in this case, the
            wonders of Europa...

            ...which were recorded for the
            first time in human history, today.

            It is absolutely astonishing.

            Voyager 1 got very good pictures
            of the other three big moons...

            ...Galilean satellites of
            Jupiter, but not of Europa.

            It was left to Voyager 2 today...

            ...to get the first close-up
            pictures of Europa...

            ...where we see things that are
            only a few kilometers across.

            At first glance, it looks
            like nothing so much as...

            ...the canal network of Mars that Percival
            Lowell imagined existed on that planet.

            We see an amazing, intricate
            network of crisscrossing...

            ...straight and curved lines.

            Are these straight lines ridges?

            Are they troughs?

            Is it connected with plate
            tectonics on the Earth?

            How does it illuminate the other
            satellites of the Jovian system?

            At this moment, the
            vaunted technology...

            ...has produced something astonishing.

            But it remains for...

            ...the limitations and
            cleverness of another device...

            ...the human brain, to figure it out.

            Fortunately, we have plenty
            of pictures to help us.

            What about Gene's idea of
            geysers down the troughs?

            Geysers down the troughs?

            LARR Y SODERBLOM: You need
            a mechanism to drive it.

            SAGAN: Larry Soderblom,
            Voyager imaging team.

            LARRY: An idea was proposed a while
            ago that we might have a sort of...

            ...champagne-bottle
            model. And that's...

            You seal the crust and have
            liquid underneath that solid crust.

            Do you have then a condition which
            is an explosive effervescence?

            SAGAN: Lonnie Lane,
            deputy project scientist.

            You have enough resolution in
            some of these pictures that...

            ...you don't see
            anything spread laterally.

            Do we have the high-resolution piece?

            -It was right here.
            -There it is.

            We'll pick out the relief,
            and if we're going to see...

            ...the things we recognize...

            SAGAN: Weeks after the pictures
            from Europa were received...

            ...we were still
            debating what was in them.

            It's as if we almost got to the...

            Look at the mesas here.

            We almost got the resolution
            needed to see the craters.

            The craters which would last
            indefinitely on a crust this thin.

            Apart from the r?seaus...

            ...there's a set of very
            fine small dots, markings...

            ...mostly in the mottled terrain.

            Like those guys. Do
            you think those are...

            ...sites of outgassing,
            calderas, fumaroles, solfataras?

            I don't know, but I'll tell
            you one thing I just found...

            Look right here.

            It disappeared.

            See the central peak?

            See the little hole?

            I think it's an impact crater.
            Look at the central peak.

            SAGAN: There are almost
            no impact craters.

            Wait, we just found one.

            Almost none.

            Therefore, finding one which is
            alleged to be the exception...

            ...maybe it's not the
            exception, but something else.

            Perhaps, but you asked about those
            little holes that we can't make out.

            The big craters go away by
            some rheological deformation...

            ...and the little ones stay
            but are out of our resolution.

            That's because they're one-tenth
            the depth of the rigid crust.

            Well, maybe.

            SAGAN: Computer processing of
            the pictures has revealed...

            ...at least a few features on Europa
            which seem to be impact craters.

            But something...

            ...has wiped out the big craters.

            Computer processing also
            played a major role...

            ...in one of the most amazing Voyager
            discoveries made on the moon next to Europa...

            ...a world called lo.

            Even from Earth we could tell
            that lo had a strange color.

            We knew that somehow sulfur had
            been removed from its surface...

            ...and ejected into a great
            doughnut of gas orbiting Jupiter.

            Then Voyager 1 sailed close to lo.

            There were a few places on lo which
            looked like the mouths of volcanoes...

            ...but it was hard to be sure.

            Then, Linda Morabito, a member
            of the Voyager navigation team...

            ...used a computer to enhance
            in a picture the edge of lo...

            ...in order to bring
            out the stars behind.

            Four days after the Voyager
            1 encounter with Jupiter...

            ...I was looking at an
            optical navigation frame.

            In enhancing this particular quadrant,
            what became very evident to me...

            ...was an anomalous crescent...

            ...in the upper left-hand
            corner, just off the limb of lo.

            SAGAN: What was it?

            The plume was in exactly the position...

            ...of one of the suspected volcanoes.

            We realized then that
            what we were observing...

            ...was a volcanic plume and,
            in fact, a volcanic eruption.

            SAGAN: Voyager had discovered the
            first active volcano beyond the Earth.

            We then found that
            lo has many volcanoes.

            There are at least nine
            intermittently active plumes...

            ...and hundreds, maybe
            thousands, of extinct ones.

            The plumes can eject sulfur and
            other atoms off lo altogether...

            ...and account for the sulfur
            clouds surrounding Jupiter.

            Rivers of molten sulfur flow down
            the sides of the volcanic mountains...

            ...and are the probable source
            of Io's distinctive colors.

            The volcanoes may be tapping some vast
            underground ocean of liquid sulfur...

            ...beneath a surface that is
            only a few thousand years old.

            So far, in our voyages to
            the outer solar system...

            ...we humans have stayed home...

            ...and sent robots and computers
            to explore in our stead.

            Someday, perhaps, we'll go ourselves.

            But suppose...

            ...like those Dutch sea
            captains of the 17th century...

            ...the computers aboard
            Voyager could keep a ship's log.

            That log, a combination of the
            events of Voyagers 1 and 2...

            ...might read something like this:

            Day 1: After much concern about
            provisions and instruments...

            ...we successfully lift off from
            Cape Canaveral on our long journey...

            ...to the planets and the stars.

            Day 13: We have taken the first
            photograph of the Earth and moon...

            ...as worlds together
            in space. A pretty pair.

            Day 170: A problem in the
            deployment of the boom...

            ...that supports the
            science scan platform.

            If the problem is not solved...

            ...we will be unable to
            take most of our pictures.

            Day 207: Boom problem solved, but
            failure of main radio transmitter.

            If the backup transmitter also fails...

            ...no one on Earth will
            ever hear from us again.

            Day 215:

            We cross the orbit of Mars...

            ...and enter the main asteroid belt.

            Day 570: We can now make out
            finer detail on Jupiter...

            ...than the largest telescopes
            on Earth have ever obtained.

            Day 640:

            The cloud patterns are
            distinctive and gorgeous.

            No painter trapped on Earth...

            ...ever imagined a world
            so strange and lovely.

            The white clouds are ammonia
            crystals, high and cold.

            We do not know the nature
            of the red-brown clouds.

            Maybe phosphorous or sulfur as a stain.

            Perhaps complex organic molecules of the
            sort that led, four billion years ago...

            ...back on Earth, to the origin of life.

            And what is the great red spot?

            (COMPUTER HUMS)

            It is an immense
            swirling column of gas...

            ...reaching high above adjacent clouds.

            So large that it could
            hold half a dozen Earths.

            Its motion hypnotizes us.

            Some think that the red spot
            is a great spinning storm...

            ...a million years old.

            Day 650: Encounter. A day of wonders.

            The ship maneuvers so
            we can take pictures...

            ...of the multi-ringed
            basin on Callisto.

            Images of the astonishing
            lined surface of Ganymede.

            A close passage by Europa.

            And, a view of volcanic lo.

            We successfully negotiate the
            treacherous radiation belts...

            ...and accomplish the
            ring plane crossing.

            Looking back, we marvel at the rings...

            ...and see the sun emerge
            from behind the giant planet.

            We are outward bound on our mission
            to explore the outer solar system.

            Ten thousand years from now...

            ...Voyager will plunge
            onward to the stars.

            We have made the ships
            that sail the sea of space.

            We travel past Jupiter...

            ...three quarters of a billion
            kilometers from the sun...

            ...Saturn, one and a half
            billion, Uranus, three billion...

            ...and Neptune, four and a
            half billion kilometers away.

            In our ship of the mind...

            ...we retrace the itinerary of
            the two Voyager spacecraft...

            ...on their journeys
            to Saturn and beyond.

            Saturn was first glimpsed
            through the telescope by Galileo.

            Its rings first understood by Huygens.

            But only now do we begin to
            penetrate its deeper mysteries.

            Saturn is the second largest
            planet in the solar system.

            Like Jupiter, it is cloud-covered,
            and rotates once every 10 hours.

            It has a weaker magnetic field,
            a weaker radiation belt...

            ...and a grand, magnificent...

            ...exquisite system of rings.

            The rings are composed of
            billions of tiny moons...

            ...each circling
            Saturn in its own orbit.

            The biggest gap in the rings is
            called the Cassini Division...

            ...after the colleague of
            Huygens who first discovered it.

            There are many other gaps...

            ...each produced by the
            periodic gravitational tugs...

            ...of one of the larger outer moons.

            From just beneath the ring plane...

            ...we see a sky full of moons.

            Within the rings, the
            individual moons become visible.

            They are orbiting
            chunks of snow and ice...

            ...each perhaps a meter across.

            In young parts of the ring system,
            there hasn't been enough time...

            ...for collisions to round
            the edges of these fragments...

            ...the snowballs of Saturn.

            Far from the rings,
            bathed in its red light...

            ...we encounter Saturn's
            immense cloud-covered moon...

            ...Titan.

            It has an atmosphere
            denser than that of Mars...

            ...and a thick layer of red clouds...

            ...which are probably composed
            of complex organic molecules...

            ...produced by solar ultraviolet
            light and other energy sources...

            ...from the methane-rich air.

            No ship from Earth has ever
            penetrated those clouds...

            ...and viewed, close-up, the
            surface of this tantalizing world.

            It seems likely that the
            ground is covered, encrusted...

            ...with organic molecules
            raining from the sky.

            There may be volcanoes
            and valleys of ice...

            ...and, just perhaps...

            ...hiding in the warm places,
            some very different kind of life.

            Near an ice cliff of Titan...

            ...through a rare break in the
            clouds of organic molecules...

            ...we can see, looming and
            lovely, the ringed planet, Saturn.

            It is a view that will still be
            appreciated centuries from now...

            ...by our descendants,
            who will know it well.

            As well as we have come to know...

            ...Hudson's Bay and the Barents Sea...

            ...Indonesia, and
            Australia and New York.

            They will look back to when Titan was
            first seen by Voyager spaceships...

            ...on their epic journeys
            past the giant planets...

            ...out of the solar system...

            ...to the great dark between the stars.

            Since Cosmos was first shown...

            ...Voyager spacecraft have explored
            the systems of the planets...

            ...Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune...

            ...and have now passed the outermost
            planets on their way to the stars.

            We inserted the flavor of those
            encounters in our captain's log.

            But with image processing...

            ...we've been able to
            reconstruct astonishing movies...

            ...of some of these worlds.

            Here, for example, is Jupiter,
            with its great red spot.

            And volcanic lo, spinning before us.

            Icy Enceladus, a tiny moon of
            Saturn, on much of which, somehow...

            ...the craters have melted.

            And Miranda, of Uranus.

            Austere, blue Neptune.

            Or consider Titan, the
            giant moon of Saturn.

            We've taken the nitrogen and
            methane in its atmosphere...

            ...irradiated it in the lab with
            electrons of the sort that are...

            ...beamed at Titan from
            Saturn's magnetic field...

            ...and we made this stuff...

            ...which matches, almost perfectly, the
            observed properties of the Titan haze.

            What is it?

            It's a mixture of
            complex organic molecules.

            You drop some into water and,
            among other things, you make...

            ...amino acids, the
            building blocks of proteins.

            So the starting materials of life...

            ...are raining from the skies
            of Titan, like manna from heaven.

            I can't wait until
            the Cassini mission...

            ...sends an entry probe through
            the organic haze of Titan...

            ...to its enigmatic surface.

            The Voyager spacecraft rush on
            past the planets and to the stars...

            ...still returning data.

            As it left the planetary
            part of the solar system...

            ...Voyager 1 turned back...

            ...to take one last portrait of
            the planets of the solar system.

            ...and one of those
            pictures was of the Earth.

            A tiny blue dot, set in a sunbeam.

            Here it is.

            That's where we live. That's home.

            We humans are one species,
            and this is our world.

            It is our responsibility to cherish it.

            Of all the worlds in our solar system,
            the only one, so far as we know...

            ...graced by life.

            SAGAN:
            The sky calls to us.

            If we do not destroy ourselves...

            ...we will one day venture
            to the stars.

            There was a time when the stars
            seemed an impenetrable mystery.

            Today, we have begun
            to understand them.

            In our personal lives also, we
            journey from ignorance to knowledge.

            Our individual growth reflects
            the advancement of the species.

            The exploration of the cosmos is...

            ...a voyage of self-discovery.

            When I was a child, I lived here...

            ...in the Bensonhurst section of
            Brooklyn in the city of New York.



            I knew my immediate
            neighborhood intimately...

            ...every candy store, front stoop...

            ...back yard, empty lot...

            ...and wall for playing
            Chinese handball.

            It was my whole world.

            But more than a few blocks away...

            ...north of the raucous traffic
            and elevated railway on 86th Street...

            ...was an unknown territory
            off-limits to my wanderings.

            It could have been Mars
            for all I knew.

            Even with an early bedtime
            in the winter...

            ...you could occasionally see
            the stars.

            I would look up at them
            and wonder what they were.

            I'd ask other kids and adults...

            ...and they would answer:



            "They're lights in the sky, kid."

            Well, I could tell they were lights
            in the sky, but what were they?

            There had to be some deeper answer.

            I remember I was issued
            my first library card.

            It was some library on 85th Street.
            Anyway, it was in alien territory.

            And I asked the librarian
            for a book on stars.

            She gave me...

            ...a picture book with portraits
            of men and women...

            ...with names like
            Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd.

            I explained that wasn't what
            I wanted at all.

            And for some reason,
            then obscure to me, she smiled...

            ...and got me another book,
            the right kind of book.

            I was so excited to know
            the answer...

            ...I opened the book breathlessly,
            right there in the library...

            ...and the book said
            something astonishing...

            ...a very big thought.

            Stars, it said, were suns...

            ...but very far away.

            The sun was a star, but close-up.

            How, I wondered, could anybody
            know such things for sure?

            How did they figure it out?
            Where did they even begin?

            I was ignorant of the idea
            of angular size.

            I didn't know about the inverse square
            law of the propagation of light.

            I didn't have any chance of
            calculating the distance to the stars.

            But I could tell that if
            the stars were suns...

            ...they had to be awfully far away.

            Further away than 86th Street,
            further away than Manhattan...

            ...further away, probably,
            than New Jersey.

            The universe had become
            much grander...

            ...than I had ever guessed.

            And then I read
            another astonishing fact.

            The Earth, which includes Brooklyn...

            ...was a planet.

            It went around the sun.

            There were other planets.

            They also went around the sun...

            ...some closer to the sun,
            some further from the sun.

            But planets didn't shine by their
            own light the way the sun does.

            No, planets simply reflected
            the little bit of light...

            ...that shines on them
            from the sun back to us.

            If you were a great distance
            from the sun...

            ...you wouldn't be able to see
            the Earth or the other planets at all.

            Well, then, it stood
            to reason, I thought...

            ...that those other stars ought to
            have their own planets...

            ...and some of those planets
            ought to have life.

            Why not?

            And that life ought to be pretty
            different from life as we know it...

            ...life here in Brooklyn.

            Ganymede. Look at this
            amazing Ganymede stuff.

            Wait, wait, wait.

            As a child, it was
            my immense good fortune...

            ...to have parents and a few teachers
            who encouraged my curiosity.

            This was my 6th-grade classroom.

            I came back here one day
            to remember what it was like.

            I brought some of the pictures
            of other worlds...

            ...that were radioed back
            by the Voyager spacecraft...

            ...of Jupiter and its moons.

            This is Calisto which is...

            (SAGAN LAUGHS)

            What is a Calisto?
            I want a Calisto.

            Now you got it.
            What is it?

            It's the outermost
            big moon of Jupiter.

            Who is this guy? Europa.

            Another Europa.

            A black-and-white picture
            of a ring of Jupiter.

            There you go.
            That's a prize for honesty.

            You didn't get a second.

            Which one would you like?

            Every one of us begins life
            with an open mind...

            ...a driving curiosity,
            a sense of wonder.

            I thought it might be fun
            if we now had some questions.

            Why is the Earth round?
            Why isn't it square or any other shape?

            That's a good question.

            That's a question I've asked myself.
            The answer has to do with gravity.

            The Earth has a strong gravity.

            If you were to make a mountain
            very high...

            ...higher than Everest,
            the biggest mountain on Earth...

            ...it would be crushed
            by its own weight.

            Gravity pulls everything
            towards the center.

            So any really big bump
            on the Earth is crushed.

            But if you had a small object,
            a tiny world...

            ...the gravity is very low...

            ...and then it can be very different
            from a sphere.

            I think I have here
            a world that isn't a sphere.

            Here.

            Look at this one.

            See? It's lumpy.

            It's a lumpy world.

            It looks like a potato.

            There's a large potato
            orbiting the planet Mars.

            This is one of the moons of Mars.

            That's a perfect example.

            You can have big departures from
            a sphere if your gravity is low.

            Now the question in the front.

            Is the sun considered part
            of the Milky Way galaxy?

            Sure, you're considered part
            of the Milky Way galaxy.

            Everything except other galaxies is
            part of the Milky Way galaxy.

            The sun is one star.

            There is a few hundred billion stars
            in the Milky Way.

            Around each star, maybe,
            is a whole bunch of planets.

            And on one of those planets is life...

            ...and one of the life forms
            on that planet is you.

            You're a part of
            the Milky Way galaxy too.

            Sometimes I think, how lucky we are
            to live in this time...

            ...the first moment in human history
            when we are, in fact...

            ...visiting other worlds...

            ...and engaging in a deep
            reconnaissance of the cosmos.

            But if we had been born
            in a much earlier age...

            ...no matter how great our dedication,
            we couldn't have understood...

            ...what the stars and planets are.

            We would not have known that there
            were other suns and other worlds.

            This is one of the great secrets
            wrested from nature...

            ...through a million years of patient
            observation and courageous thinking.

            Human beings have always asked
            questions about the stars.

            It's as natural as breathing.

            But imagine a time before science
            had found out the answers.

            Imagine what it was like, say...

            ...hundreds of thousands
            of years ago...

            ...soon after the discovery of fire.

            We were just as smart
            and just as curious then...

            ...as we are now.

            Sometimes it seems to me that...

            ...there were people then
            who thought like this:

            We are wandering hunter folk.

            Fire keeps us warm.

            Its light makes holes in the darkness.

            It keeps hungry animals away.

            In the darkness,
            we can see each other and talk.

            We take care of the flame.

            The flame takes care of us.

            The stars are not near to us.

            When we climb a hill or a tree,
            they are no closer.

            They flicker with
            a strange, cold, white...

            ...faraway light.

            Many of them, all over the sky,
            but only at night.

            I wonder what they are.

            One night I thought
            the stars are flames.

            They give a little light
            at night as fire does.

            Maybe the stars are campfires...

            ...which other wanderers
            light at night.

            The stars give a much
            smaller light than campfires...

            ...so they must be very far away.

            I wonder if our campfires...

            ...look like stars to the people
            in the sky.

            But why don't those campfires
            and the wanderers who made them...

            ...fall down at our feet?

            Why don't strange tribes
            drop from the sky?

            Those beings in the sky
            must have great powers.

            I don't suppose
            that every hunter-gatherer...

            ...had such thoughts about the stars.

            But we know from contemporary
            hunter-gatherer communities...

            ...that very imaginative ideas arise.

            The Kung Bushmen...

            ...of the Kalahari Desert
            in the Republic of Botswana...

            ...have an explanation
            of the Milky Way.

            At their latitude,
            it's often overhead.

            They call it the "backbone of night."

            They believe it holds the sky up.

            They believe that if not
            for the Milky Way...

            ...pieces of sky would come crashing
            down at our feet.

            So the Milky Way, in their view,
            has some practical value.

            The backbone of night.

            Later on, metaphors about...

            ...campfires or backbones...

            ...or holes through which
            the flame could be seen...

            ...were replaced in most human
            communities by another idea.

            The powerful beings in the sky
            were promoted to gods.

            They were given names and relatives...

            ...and special responsibilities...

            ...for the cosmic services they were
            expected to perform.

            There was a god
            for every human concern.

            Gods ran nature.

            Nothing happened without the direct
            intervention of some god.

            If the gods were happy,
            there was plenty of food...

            ...and humans were happy.

            But if something
            displeased the gods...

            ...and it didn't take much,
            the consequences were awesome:

            Droughts, floods, storms, wars...

            ...earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
            epidemics.

            The gods had to be propitiated.

            And a vast industry
            of priests arose...

            ...to make the gods less angry.

            But because the gods
            were capricious...

            ...you couldn't be sure
            what they would do.

            Nature was a mystery.

            It was hard to understand the world.

            Our ancestors groped in darkness...

            ...to make sense
            of their surroundings.

            Powerless before nature...

            ...they invented rituals and myths...

            ...some desperate and cruel...

            ...others imaginative and benign.

            The ancient Greeks explained...

            ...that diffuse band of brightness
            in the night sky...

            ...as the milk of the goddess Hera...

            ...squirted from her breast
            across the heavens.

            We still call it the Milky Way.

            In gratitude for the many gifts
            of the gods...

            ...our ancestors created works
            of surpassing beauty.

            This is all that remains...

            ...of the ancient temple of Hera,
            queen of heaven:

            A single marble column standing
            in a vast field of ruins...

            ...on the Greek island of Samos.

            It was one of the wonders
            of the world...

            ...built by people with
            an extraordinary eye for clarity...

            ...and symmetry.

            Those who thronged to that temple...

            ...were also the architects
            of a bridge...

            ...from their world to ours.

            We were moving once again
            in our voyage of self-discovery...

            ...on our journey to the stars.

            Here, 25 centuries ago...

            ...on the island of Samos
            and in the other Greek colonies...

            ...which had grown up
            in the busy Aegean Sea...

            ...there was a glorious awakening.

            Suddenly, people believed
            that everything was made of atoms...

            ...that human beings and other animals
            had evolved from simpler forms...

            ...that diseases were not caused by
            demons or the gods...

            ...that the Earth was only
            a planet going around a sun...

            ...which was very far away.

            This revolution made cosmos
            out of chaos.

            Here, in the sixth century B.C.,
            a new idea developed...

            ...one of the great ideas
            of the human species.

            It was argued that the universe
            was knowable.

            Why? Because it was ordered.

            Because there are regularities
            in nature...

            ...which permitted secrets
            to be uncovered.

            Nature was not entirely unpredictable.

            There were rules which even
            she had to obey.

            This ordered and admirable character
            of the universe...

            ...was called cosmos.

            And it was set
            in stark contradiction...

            ...to the idea of chaos.

            This was the first conflict
            of which we know...

            ...between science and mysticism...

            ...between nature and the gods.

            But why here?

            Why in these remote islands and inlets
            of the eastern Mediterranean?

            Why not in the great cities of...

            ...India or Egypt, Babylon,
            China, Mesoamerica?

            Because they were all
            at the center of old empires.

            They were set in their ways,
            hostile to new ideas.

            But here in Ionia...

            ...were a multitude of newly colonized
            islands and city-states.

            Isolation, even if incomplete,
            promotes diversity.

            No single concentration of power
            could enforce conformity.

            Free inquiry became possible.

            They were beyond the frontiers
            of the empires.

            The merchants and tourists
            and sailors of Africa...

            ...Asia and Europe
            met in the harbors of Ionia...

            ...to exchange goods
            and stories and ideas.

            There was a vigorous and heady
            interaction...

            ...of many traditions, prejudices,
            languages and gods.

            These people were ready to experiment.

            Once you are open to
            questioning rituals...

            ...and time-honored practices...

            ...you find that one question
            leads to another.

            What do you do when you're faced
            with several different gods...

            ...each claiming the same territory?

            The Babylonian Marduk
            and the Greek Zeus...

            ...were each considered
            king of the gods...

            ...master of the sky.

            You might decide, since they otherwise
            had different attributes...

            ...that one of them was merely
            invented by the priests.

            But if one, why not both?

            And so it was here
            that the great idea arose:

            The realization that there
            might be a way...

            ...to know the world
            without the god hypothesis.

            That there be principles,
            forces, laws of nature...

            ...through which the world might be
            understood without attributing...

            ...the fall of every sparrow to
            the direct intervention of Zeus.

            This is the place
            where science was born.

            That's why we're here.

            This Greek revolution happened
            between 600 and 400 B.C.

            It was accomplished by the same
            practical and productive people...

            ...who made the society function.

            Political power was in the hands
            of the merchants...

            ...who promoted the technology
            on which their prosperity depended.

            The earliest pioneers
            of science were...

            ...merchants and artisans
            and their children.

            The first Ionian scientist was
            named Thales.

            He was born over there
            in the city of Miletus...

            ...across this narrow strait.

            He had traveled in Egypt...

            ...and was conversant
            with the knowledge of Babylon.

            Like the Babylonians, he believed
            that the world had once all been water.

            To explain the dry land...

            ...the Babylonians added
            that their god, Marduk...

            ...had placed a mat on the face
            of the waters...

            ...and piled dirt on top of it.

            Thales had a similar view...

            ...but he left Marduk out.

            Yes, the world had once been
            mostly water...

            ...but it was a natural process
            which explained the dry land.

            Thales thought it was similar to
            the silting up he had observed...

            ...at the delta of the river Nile.

            Whether Thales' conclusions
            were right or wrong...

            ...is not nearly as important
            as his approach.

            The world was not made by the gods...

            ...but instead was the result
            of material forces...

            ...interacting in nature.

            Thales brought back from
            Babylon and Egypt...

            ...the seeds of new sciences:

            Astronomy and geometry...

            ...sciences which would
            sprout and grow...

            ...in the fertile soil of Ionia.

            Anaximander of Miletus, over there...

            ...was a friend and colleague
            of Thales...

            ...one of the first people
            that we know of...

            ...to have actually done
            an experiment.

            By examining the moving shadow
            cast by a vertical stick...

            ...he determined accurately
            the lengths of the year and seasons.

            For ages, men had used sticks...

            ...to club and spear each other.

            Anaximander used a stick
            to measure time.

            In 540 B.C., or thereabouts,
            on this island of Samos...

            ...there came to power a tyrant
            named Polycrates.

            He seems to have started
            as a caterer...

            ...and then went on to
            international piracy.

            His loot was unloaded
            on this very breakwater.

            (DRUM BEATS)

            But he oppressed his own people,
            he made war on his neighbors.

            He quite rightly feared invasion.

            So Polycrates surrounded his capital
            city with an impressive wall...

            ...whose remains stand till this day.

            To carry water from a distant spring
            through the fortifications...

            ...he ordered this great tunnel built.

            A kilometer long,
            it pierces a mountain.

            Two cuttings were dug
            from either side...

            ...which met almost perfectly
            in the middle.

            The project took some 1 5 years
            to complete.

            It is a token of the civil engineering
            of its day...

            ...and an indication of the
            extraordinary practical capability...

            ...of the Ionians.

            The enduring legacy of the Ionians...

            ...is the tools and techniques
            they developed...

            ...which remain the basis
            of modern technology.

            This was the time of Theodorus...

            ...the master engineer of the age...

            ...a man who is credited with
            the invention of...

            ...the key, the ruler,
            the carpenter's square...

            ...the level, the lathe,
            bronze casting.

            Why are there no monuments
            to this man?

            Those who dreamt and speculated...

            ...and deduced about
            the laws of nature...

            ...talked to the engineers
            and the technologists.

            They were often the same people.

            The practical and the theoretical
            were one.

            (DRUM BEATS)

            This new hybrid of abstract thought...

            ...and everyday experience
            blossomed into science.

            When these practical men turned
            their attention to the natural world...

            ...they began to uncover
            hidden wonders...

            ...and breathtaking possibilities.

            Anaximander studied the profusion
            of living things...

            ...and saw their interrelationships.

            He concluded that life had originated
            in water and mud...

            ...and then colonized the dry land.

            "Human beings," he said...

            "...must have evolved
            from simpler forms."

            This insight had to wait 24 centuries
            until its truth was demonstrated...

            ...by Charles Darwin.

            Nothing was excluded from the
            investigations of the first scientists.

            Even the air became the subject
            of close examination...

            ...by a Greek from Sicily
            named Empedocles.

            He made an astonishing discovery...

            ...with a household implement
            that people had used for centuries.

            This is the so-called
            water thief.

            It's a brazen sphere with a neck
            and a hole at the top...

            ...and a set of little holes
            at the bottom.

            It was used as a kitchen ladle.

            You fill it by immersing it in water.

            lf, after it's been in there
            a little bit...

            ...you pull it out
            with the neck uncovered...

            ...then the water trickles out
            the little holes making a small shower.

            Instead, if you pull it out
            with the neck covered...

            ...the water is retained.

            Now try to fill it...

            ...with the neck covered
            with my thumb.

            Nothing happens.

            Why not?

            There's something in the way.

            Some material is blocking the access
            of the water into the sphere.

            I can't see any such material.

            What could it be?

            Empedocles identified it...

            ...as air.

            What else could it be?

            A thing you can't see
            can exert pressure...

            ...can frustrate my wish to fill
            this vessel with water...

            ...if I were dumb enough to
            leave my thumb on the neck.

            Empedocles had discovered...

            ...the invisible.

            Air, he thought, must be matter...

            ...in a form so finely divided...

            ...that it couldn't be seen.

            This hint, this whiff
            of the existence of atoms...

            ...was carried much further by
            a contemporary named Democritus.

            Of all the ancient scientists, it is
            he who speaks most clearly to us...

            ...across the centuries.

            The few surviving fragments
            of his scientific writings...

            ...reveal a mind of the highest
            logical and intuitive powers.

            He believed that a large number of
            other worlds wander through space...

            ...that worlds are born and die...

            ...that some are
            rich and living creatures...

            ...and others are dry and barren.

            He was the first to understand
            that the Milky Way...

            ...is an aggregate of the light
            of innumerable faint stars.

            Beyond campfires in the sky,
            beyond the milk of Hera...

            ...beyond the backbone of night,
            the mind of Democritus soared.

            He saw deep connections between
            the heavens and the Earth.

            "Man," he said, "is a microcosm...

            ...a little cosmos."

            Democritus came from
            the Ionian town of Abdera...

            ...on the northern Aegean shore.

            In those days, Abdera was
            the butt of jokes.

            lf, around the year 400 B.C...

            ...in the equivalent
            of a restaurant like this...

            ...you told a story about
            someone from Abdera...

            ...you were guaranteed a laugh.

            It was, in a way...

            ...the Brooklyn of its time.

            For Democritus, all of life was to be
            enjoyed and understood.

            For him, understanding and enjoyment...

            ...were pretty much the same thing.

            He said, "A life without festivity is
            a long road without an inn."

            Democritus may have come from Abdera,
            but he was no dummy.

            Democritus understood
            that the complex forms...

            ...changes and motions
            of the material world...

            ...all derived from the interaction
            of very simple moving parts.

            He called these parts atoms.

            All material objects are
            collections of atoms...

            ...intricately assembled...

            ...even we.

            When I cut this apple...

            ...the knife must be
            passing through...

            ...empty spaces between the atoms,
            Democritus argued.

            If there were no such empty spaces,
            no void...

            ...then the knife would encounter
            some impenetrable atom...

            ...and the apple wouldn't be cut.

            Let's compare the cross sections
            of the two pieces.

            Are the exposed areas exactly equal?

            No, said Democritus,
            the curvature of the apple...

            ...forces this slice to be slightly
            shorter than the rest of the apple.

            If they were equally tall,
            then we'd have...

            ...a cylinder and not an apple.

            No matter how sharp the knife...

            ...these two pieces have
            unequal cross sections.

            But why?

            Because on the scale
            of the very small...

            ...matter exhibits some
            irreducible roughness...

            ...and this fine scale of roughness
            Democritus of Abdera identified...

            ...with the world of the atoms.

            His arguments are not those
            we use today.

            But they're elegant and subtle
            and derived from everyday experience.

            And his conclusions were
            fundamentally right.

            Democritus believed that nothing
            happens at random...

            ...that everything has
            a material cause.

            He said, "I would rather understand
            one cause...

            ...than be king of Persia."

            He believed that poverty
            in a democracy was far better...

            ...than wealth in a tyranny.

            He believed that the prevailing
            religions of his time were evil...

            ...and that neither souls
            nor immortal gods existed.

            There is no evidence that Democritus
            was persecuted for his beliefs.

            But then again, he came from Abdera.

            However, in his time...

            ...the brief tradition of tolerance
            for unconventional views...

            ...was beginning to erode.

            For instance,
            the prevailing belief was...

            ...that the moon and the sun
            were gods.

            Another contemporary of Democritus,
            named Anaxagoras, taught...

            ...that the moon was a place
            made of ordinary matter...

            ...and that the sun was a red-hot stone
            far away in the sky.

            For this, Anaxagoras was condemned...

            ...convicted and imprisoned
            for impiety...

            ...a religious crime.

            People began to be persecuted
            for their ideas.

            A portrait of Democritus is now...

            ...on the Greek 100-drachma note.

            But his ideas were suppressed...

            ...and his influence on history
            made minor.

            The mystics were beginning to win.

            (DRUM BEATS)

            You see, Ionia was also the home...

            ...of another quite different
            intellectual tradition.

            Its founder was Pythagoras...

            ...who lived here on Samos
            in the 6th century B.C.

            According to local legend...

            ...this cave was once his abode.

            Maybe that was once his living room.

            Many centuries later...

            ...this small Greek Orthodox shrine
            was erected on his front porch.

            There's a continuity of tradition
            from Pythagoras to Christianity.

            Pythagoras was the first person
            in the history of the world...

            ...to decide that the Earth
            was a sphere.

            Perhaps he argued by analogy
            with the moon or the sun...

            ...maybe he noticed the curved shadow
            of the Earth on the moon...

            ...during a lunar eclipse.

            Or maybe he recognized
            that when ships leave Samos...

            ...their masts disappear last.

            Pythagoras believed that
            a mathematical harmony...

            ...underlies all of nature.

            The modern tradition
            of mathematical argument...

            ...essential in all of science
            owes much to him.

            And the notion that the heavenly bodies
            move to a kind of...

            ...music of the spheres...

            ...was also derived from Pythagoras.

            It was he who first used
            the word cosmos...

            ...to mean a well-ordered
            and harmonious universe...

            ...a world amenable
            to human understanding.

            For this great idea,
            we are indebted to Pythagoras.

            But there were deep ironies
            and contradictions in his thoughts.

            Many of the Ionians believed...

            ...that the underlying harmony and
            unity of the universe was accessible...

            ...through observation
            and experiment...

            ...the method which dominates
            science today.

            However, Pythagoras had
            a very different method.

            He believed that the laws of nature
            can be deduced by pure thought.

            He and his followers were not
            basically experimentalists...

            ...they were mathematicians...

            ...and they were
            thoroughgoing mystics.

            They were fascinated by these
            five regular solids...

            ...bodies whose faces
            are all polygons:

            Triangles or squares...

            ...or pentagons.

            There can be an infinite number
            of polygons...

            ...but only five regular solids.

            Four of the solids were associated
            with earth, fire, air and water.

            The cube, for example,
            represented earth.

            These four elements, they thought,
            make up terrestrial matter.

            So the fifth solid...

            ...they mystically associated
            with the cosmos.

            Perhaps it was the substance
            of the heavens.

            This fifth solid was called...

            ...the dodecahedron.

            Its faces are pentagons, 1 2 of them.

            Knowledge of the dodecahedron...

            ...was considered too dangerous
            for the public.

            Ordinary people were to be
            kept ignorant of the dodecahedron.

            In love with whole numbers,
            the Pythagoreans believed...

            ...that all things could be
            derived from them...

            ...certainly all other numbers.

            So a crisis in doctrine occurred
            when they discovered...

            ...that the square root of two
            was irrational.

            The square root of two could
            not be represented as the ratio...

            ...of two whole numbers
            no matter how big they were.

            Irrational originally meant
            only that...

            ...that you can't express a number
            as a ratio.

            But for the Pythagoreans,
            it came to mean something else...

            ...something threatening...

            ...a hint that their world-view
            might not make sense...

            ...the other meaning of irrational.

            Instead of wanting everyone to share
            and know of their discoveries...

            ...the Pythagoreans suppressed
            the square root of two...

            ...and the dodecahedron.

            The outside world was not to know.

            The Pythagoreans had discovered...

            ...in the mathematical underpinnings
            of nature...

            ...one of the two most
            powerful scientific tools.

            The other, of course, is experiment.

            But instead of using their insight
            to advance...

            ...the collective voyage
            of human discovery...

            ...they made of it little more
            than the hocus-pocus of a mystery cult.

            Science and mathematics were to be
            removed from the hands...

            ...of merchants and artisans.

            This tendency found its most
            effective advocate...

            ...in a follower of Pythagoras
            named Plato.

            He preferred the perfection
            of these mathematical abstractions...

            ...to the imperfections
            of everyday life.

            He believed that ideas were far more
            real than the natural world.

            He advised the astronomers
            not to waste their time...

            ...observing stars and planets.

            It was better, he believed,
            just to think about them.

            Plato expressed hostility to
            observation and experiment.

            He taught contempt
            for the real world...

            ...and disdain for the practical
            application of scientific knowledge.

            Plato's followers succeeded
            in extinguishing the light...

            ...of science and experiment...

            ...that had been kindled
            by Democritus and the other Ionians.

            Plato's unease with the world
            as revealed by our senses...

            ...was to dominate
            and stifle Western philosophy.

            Even as late as 1600...

            ...Johannes Kepler was still
            struggling to interpret...

            ...the structure of
            the cosmos in terms of...

            ...Pythagorean solids
            and Platonic perfection.

            Ironically, it was Kepler who helped
            re-establish the old Ionian method...

            ...of testing ideas
            against observations.

            But why had science lost its way
            in the first place?

            What appeal did Pythagoras'
            and Plato's teachings...

            ...have for their contemporaries?

            They provided, I believe...

            ...an intellectually
            respectable justification...

            ...for a corrupt social order.

            The mercantile tradition which had
            led to Ionian science...

            ...also led to a slave economy.

            You could get richer...

            ...if you owned a lot of slaves.

            Athens, in the time
            of Plato and Aristotle...

            ...had a vast slave population.

            All of that brave Athenian talk
            about democracy...

            ...applied only to a privileged few.

            Plato and Aristotle were comfortable
            in a slave society.

            They offered justifications
            for oppression.

            They served tyrants.

            They taught the alienation
            of the body from the mind...

            ...a natural enough idea, I suppose,
            in a slave society.

            They separated thought from matter.

            They divorced the Earth
            from the heavens.

            Divisions which were to dominate
            Western thinking...

            ...for more than 20 centuries.

            The Pythagoreans had won.

            In the recognition by
            Pythagoras and Plato...

            ...that the cosmos is knowable...

            ...that there is a mathematical
            underpinning to nature...

            ...they greatly advanced
            the cause of science.

            But in the suppression
            of disquieting facts...

            ...the sense that science should be
            kept for a small elite...

            ...the distaste for experiment,
            the embrace of mysticism...

            ...the easy acceptance
            of slave societies...

            ...their influence has
            significantly set back...

            ...the human endeavor.

            The books of the Ionian scientists
            are entirely lost.

            Their views were suppressed,
            ridiculed and forgotten...

            ...by the Platonists
            and by the Christians...

            ...who adopted much of
            the philosophy of Plato.

            Finally, after a long,
            mystical sleep...

            ...in which the tools of
            scientific inquiry lay moldering...

            ...the Ionian approach was
            rediscovered.

            The Western world reawakened.

            Experiment and open inquiry...

            ...slowly became respectable
            once again.

            Forgotten books and fragments were
            read once more.

            Leonardo and Copernicus
            and Columbus...

            ...were inspired by
            the Ionian tradition.

            The Pythagoreans
            and their successors...

            ...held the peculiar notion that...

            ...the Earth was tainted...

            ...somehow nasty...

            ...while the heavens were
            pristine and divine.

            So the fundamental idea
            that the Earth is a planet...

            ...that we're citizens
            of the universe...

            ...was rejected and forgotten.

            This idea was first argued
            by Aristarchus...

            ...born here on Samos,
            three centuries after Pythagoras.

            He held that the Earth moves
            around the sun.

            He correctly located our place
            in the solar system.

            For his trouble,
            he was accused of heresy.

            From the size of the Earth's shadow
            on the moon during a lunar eclipse...

            ...he deduced that the sun
            had to be much, much larger...

            ...than the Earth,
            and also very far away.

            From this he may have argued
            that it was absurd...

            ...for so large an object as the sun
            to be going around...

            ...so small an object as the Earth.

            So he put the sun rather than the Earth
            at the center of the solar system.

            And he had the Earth and the other
            planets going around the sun.

            He also had the Earth rotating
            on its axis once a day.

            These are ideas that we ordinarily
            associate with the name Copernicus.

            But Copernicus seems to have gotten
            some hint of these ideas...

            ...by reading about Aristarchus.

            In fact, in the manuscript
            of Copernicus' book...

            ...he referred to Aristarchus,
            but in the final version...

            ...he suppressed the citation.

            Resistance to Aristarchus,
            a kind of...

            ...geocentrism in everyday life,
            is with us still.

            We still talk about a sun rising...

            ...and the sun setting.

            It's 2200 years since Aristarchus...

            ...and the language still pretends
            that the Earth does not turn...

            ...that the sun is not at the center
            of the solar system.

            Aristarchus understood the basic
            scheme of the solar system...

            ...but not its scale.

            He knew that the planets move
            in concentric orbits about the sun...

            ...and he probably knew their order
            out to Saturn.

            But he was much too modest
            in his estimates...

            ...of how far apart the planets are.

            In order to calculate the true scale
            of the solar system...

            ...you need a telescope.

            It wasn't until the 1 7th century
            that astronomers were able to get...

            ...even a rough estimate
            of the distance to the sun.

            And once you knew
            the distance to the sun...

            ...what about the stars?

            How far away are they?

            There is a way to measure
            the distance to the stars...

            ...and the Ionians were
            fully capable of discovering it.

            Aristarchus had toyed
            with the daring idea...

            ...that the stars were distant suns.

            Now, if a star were as near
            as the sun...

            ...it should appear as big
            and as bright as the sun.

            Everyone knows that the farther away
            an object is, the smaller it seems.

            This inverse proportionality between
            apparent size and distance...

            ...is the basis of perspective
            in art and photography.

            So the further away we are
            from the sun...

            ...the smaller and dimmer it appears.

            How far from the sun would we
            have to be for it to appear...

            ...as small and dim as a star?

            Or equivalently,
            how small a piece of sun...

            ...would be as bright as a star?

            An experiment to answer this question
            was performed in 17th-century Holland...

            ...by Christiaan Huygens and is
            very much in the Ionian tradition.

            Huygens drilled a number of holes
            in a brass plate...

            ...and held the plate up to the sun.

            He asked himself,
            which hole seemed as bright...

            ...as he remembered the star Sirius
            to have been the previous evening.

            Well, the hole that matched was
            effectively...

            ...1 l28,000th the apparent size
            of the sun.

            So Sirius, he reasoned,
            must be 28,000 times...

            ...further away than the sun,
            or about half a light-year away.

            It's hard to remember
            just how bright a star is...

            ...hours after you've looked at it,
            but Huygens remembered very well.

            If he had known that Sirius was
            intrinsically brighter than the sun...

            ...he would've gotten
            the answer exactly right.

            Sirius is 8.8 light-years
            away from us.

            Between Aristarchus and Huygens...

            ...people had answered that question
            which had so excited me...

            ...as a young boy growing up
            in Brooklyn:

            The question, "What are the stars?"

            And the answer is that the stars are
            mighty suns, light-years away...

            ...in the depths
            of interstellar space.

            And around those suns,
            are there other planets?

            And on those other worlds...

            ...are there beings
            who wonder as we do?

            Here is a light bulb...

            ...which is supposed to represent
            a nearby star.

            Next to it, and very hard to see
            because of the bright light...

            ...is a planet.

            We'll need a volunteer.
            Who would like to come up, please?

            Ordinarily, it's hard to
            see the planet...

            ...because it's so close that the star
            washes out the planet.

            But if we're able to put something
            in front of the star...

            ...to make an artificial eclipse,
            then we might be able to see the planet.

            I'm gonna stand over here.
            Imagine that I'm a telescope...

            ...somewhere near the Earth.

            And, Tab, if you'd slowly move
            the disc across.

            Good. A little faster would be nice.

            Now you're just beginning to cover
            over the star.

            I really can't see the planet at all.
            Keep going.

            Now, right there...

            ...I can't see the star at all...

            ...and I see the planet lit
            by the light of the star.

            Now, that is a method for looking
            for planets...

            ...around nearby stars.

            And that method uses a spacecraft
            to hold the disc...

            ...and scan the sky
            for another telescope...

            ...to see if there are any planets.

            Tab, you accomplished your mission
            to look for planets around other stars.

            Thank you for being
            our interplanetary spacecraft.

            So this is one way.

            And there are spaceships
            that will be able to do this...

            ...in the next 1 0 years or so.

            And there's another way.

            This has already been tried
            from the Earth.

            Imagine that there's a nearby star
            that you can see.

            It's bright and it has
            a dark companion, a planet...

            ...shining only by reflected light
            near it, so dim you can't see it.

            But imagine that this planet
            and its star...

            ...are going around each other.

            Like that:

            You can see the star,
            you can't see the planet.

            So now I'm gonna need two volunteers.

            You two.

            Just to save time
            because they're in the front row.

            I need one of you to turn
            the star and the planet...

            ...and another person to pull
            the star and planet along.

            And what you will see...

            ...is that the star
            you can make out...

            ...will be moving
            in a funny, wiggly pattern...

            ...which will be the clue,
            the evidence...

            ...for the existence
            of the dark planet.

            Okay, let's have a spin. Good.
            And a pull.

            And you see this funny motion...

            ...that the star makes
            because of the planet. Thank you.

            That's another way of finding out
            the existence of a planet...

            ...that you couldn't see directly.

            Well, both of these methods are
            being used.

            And by the time that you people are...

            ...as old as I am...

            ...we should know,
            for all the nearest stars...

            ...if they have planets
            going around them.

            We might know dozens or even hundreds
            of other planetary systems...

            ...and see if they're like our own
            or very different...

            ...or no other planets
            going around other stars at all.

            That will happen in your lifetime.

            It'll be the first time in the world's
            history that anybody found out...

            ...if there are planets
            around the other stars.

            Now, the nearby stars, the ones
            you can see with the naked eye...

            ...those are all
            in the solar neighborhood.

            That's what astronomers call it:
            The neighborhood.

            But it's a very tiny place
            in the Milky Way galaxy.

            The Milky Way is that band of light...

            ...that you see across the sky
            on a clear night.

            I can't tell if there are any more
            clear nights in Brooklyn.

            You must've seen the Milky Way,
            a faint band of light at night.

            Well, that's just 100 billion stars...

            ...all seen together...

            ...edge on, as in this picture.

            If you could get out of
            the Milky Way and look down on it...

            ...it would look like that picture.

            If we did look down
            on the Milky Way...

            ...where would the sun
            and nearby stars be?

            Would it be in the center where things
            look important...

            ...or at least well-lit?

            No. We would be way out here...

            ...in the suburbs,
            in the countryside of the galaxy.

            We're not in any important place.

            All the stars you could see would be
            in a little place like that.

            And the Milky Way would be
            this band of light...

            ...100 billion stars all together.

            The fact that we live
            in the outskirts of the galaxy...

            ...was discovered a long time ago...

            ...towards the end
            of the First World War...

            ...by a man named Harlow Shapley...

            ...who was mapping the position
            of these clusters of stars.

            See, every one of these is a bunch...

            ...of maybe 1 0,000 stars all together.

            It's called a globular cluster.

            And you can see that they are
            centered around the middle...

            ...the center of the galaxy.

            People used to think that the sun was
            at the center of the galaxy...

            ...something important about our
            position. That turns out to be wrong.

            We live in the outskirts...

            ...the globular clusters are
            centered around...

            ...the marvelous middle
            of the Milky Way galaxy.

            And then it turned out
            that this isn't the only galaxy.

            We live in this one...

            ...but there are many others.

            And as this picture reminds us...

            ...there are many different kinds
            of galaxies...

            ...of which ours might be
            just this one.

            There are, in fact,
            100 billion other galaxies...

            ...each of which contains
            something like 100 billion stars.

            Think of how many stars and planets
            and kinds of life there may be...

            ...in this vast and awesome universe.

            As long as there have been humans...

            ...we have searched
            for our place in the cosmos.

            Where are we? Who are we?

            We find that we live
            on an insignificant planet...

            ...of a humdrum star...

            ...lost in a galaxy
            tucked away in some...

            ...forgotten corner of a universe
            in which there are...

            ...far more galaxies than people.

            We make our world significant by
            the courage of our questions...

            ...and by the depth of our answers.

            We embarked on our journey
            to the stars...

            ...with a question first framed...

            ...in the childhood of our species...

            ...and in each generation
            asked anew...

            ...with undiminished wonder:

            "What are the stars?"

            Exploration is in our nature.

            We began as wanderers...

            ...and we are wanderers still.

            We have lingered long enough...

            ...on the shores of the cosmic ocean.

            We are ready at last...

            ...to set sail for the stars.

            SAGAN: We are drifting in
            a great ocean of space and time.

            In that ocean, the events
            that shape the future...

            ...are working themselves out.

            Each creature and every world,
            to the remotest star...

            ...owe their existence to...

            ...the great, coursing,
            implacable forces of nature...

            ...but also, to minor happenstance.

            We are carried with our planet
            around the sun.

            The Earth has made more than
            4 billion circuits of our star...

            ...since its origin.

            The sun itself travels about
            the core of the Milky Way galaxy.



            Our galaxy is moving
            among the other galaxies.

            We have always been space travelers.

            These fine sand grains are all,
            more or less, uniform in size.

            They're produced from bigger rocks
            through ages of...

            ...jostling and rubbing,
            abrasion and erosion.

            Driven in part by
            the distant moon and sun.

            So the roots of the present
            lie buried in the past.

            We are also travelers in time.

            But trapped on Earth...

            ...we've had little to say about
            where we go in time and space...

            ...or how fast.

            But now we're thinking
            about true journeys in time...

            ...and real voyages
            to the distant stars.

            A handful of sand contains
            about 10,000 grains...



            ...more than all the stars
            we can see...

            ...with the naked eye
            on a clear night.

            But the number of stars we can see...

            ...is only the tiniest fraction
            of the number of stars that are.

            What we see at night
            is the merest smattering...

            ...of the nearest stars...

            ...with a few more distant bright
            stars thrown in for good measure.

            Meanwhile, the cosmos
            is rich beyond measure.

            The number of stars
            in the universe...

            ...is larger than all the grains
            of sand on all the beaches...

            ...of the planet Earth.

            Long ago, before we had figured out
            that the stars are distant suns...

            ...they seemed to us
            to make pictures in the sky.

            Just follow the dots.

            The Big Dipper constellation
            today in North America...

            ...has had many other incarnations.

            Every culture, ancient and modern...

            ...has placed its totems
            and concerns among the stars.

            From a Chinese bureaucrat
            to a German wagon.

            But very ancient cultures would have
            seen different constellations...

            ...because the stars move
            with respect to one another.

            We can give a computer the present
            positions and motions of stars...

            ...and then run the patterns
            back into time.

            Every constellation is a single frame
            in a cosmic movie...

            ...but because our lives
            are so short...

            ...because star patterns
            change slowly...

            ...we tend not to notice
            it's a movie.

            A million years ago,
            there was no Big Dipper.

            Our ancestors, looking up
            and wondering about the stars...

            ...saw some other pattern
            in the northern skies.

            We can also run a constellation,
            Leo the Lion, say, forward in time...

            ...and see what the patterns
            in the stars will be in the future.

            A million years from now,
            Leo might be renamed...

            ...the constellation
            of the Radio Telescope.

            Although I suspect radio telescopes
            then will be as obsolete...

            ...as stone spears are now.

            Or, here's the constellation
            of Cetus the Whale.

            A million years ago, it may have
            been called something else.

            Perhaps the Spear.

            Now, let's run fast-forward
            through a billion nights.

            Millions of years from now...

            ...some other very different image
            will be featured in this cosmic movie.

            In Orion the Hunter,
            things are changing...

            ...not only because
            the stars are moving...

            ...but also because
            the stars are evolving.

            Many of Orion's stars are
            hot, young and short-lived.

            They're born, live and die within
            a span of only a few million years.

            If we run Orion forward in time...

            ...we see the births
            and explosive deaths...

            ...of dozens of stars...

            ...flashing on and winking off
            like fireflies in the night.

            If we wait long enough,
            we see the constellations change.

            But if we go far enough,
            we also see the star patterns alter.

            Two-dimensional constellations...

            ...are only the appearance of stars
            strewn through three dimensions.

            Some are dim and near,
            others are bright but farther away.

            Could a space traveler
            actually see...

            ...the patterns of
            the constellations change?

            For that, you must travel roughly as
            far as the constellation is from us.

            Here, we're traveling
            hundreds of light-years...

            ...circling all the way around
            the stars of the Big Dipper.

            Inhabitants of planets
            around other stars...

            ...will see different constellations
            than us...

            ...because their vantage points
            are different.

            Here we are
            in the constellation Andromeda...

            ...or at least a model of it
            next to the constellation Perseus.

            Andromeda, in the Greek myth...

            ...was the maiden
            who was saved by Perseus...

            ...from a sea monster.

            This star just above me
            is Beta Andromedae...

            ...the second brightest star
            in the constellation...

            ...75 light-years from the Earth.

            The light by which we see this star...

            ...has spent 75 years
            traversing interstellar space...

            ...on its journey to the Earth.

            In the unlikely event
            that Beta Andromedae...

            ...blew itself up
            a week ago Tuesday...

            ...we will not know of it
            for another 75 years...

            ...as this interesting information,
            traveling at the speed of light...

            ...crosses the enormous
            interstellar distances.

            When the light we see
            from this star set out...

            ...on its long
            interstellar voyage...

            ...the young Albert Einstein...

            ...working as a Swiss patent clerk...

            ...had just published his epochal
            special theory of relativity...

            ...here on Earth.

            We see...

            ...that space and time
            are intertwined.

            We cannot look out into space...

            ...without looking back into time.

            The speed of light is very fast...

            ...but space is very empty...

            ...and the stars are very far apart.

            The distances that we've been
            talking about up to now...

            ...are very small
            by the usual astronomical standards.

            In fact, the distance
            from the Earth...

            ...to the center
            of the Milky Way galaxy...

            ...is 30,000 light-years.

            From our galaxy to the nearest
            spiral galaxy like our own...

            ...called M31 ...

            ...and which is also within,
            that means behind...

            ...the constellation Andromeda...

            ...is 2 million light-years.

            When the light we see today
            from M31 ...

            ...left on its journey for Earth...

            ...there were no human beings...

            ...although our ancestors
            were nicely evolving...

            ...and very rapidly,
            to our present form.

            There are much greater distances
            in astronomy.

            The distance from the Earth
            to the most distant quasars...

            ...is 8 or 10 billion light-years.

            We see them as they were before
            the Earth itself accumulated...

            ...before the Milky Way galaxy
            was formed.

            The fastest space vehicles ever
            launched by the human species...

            ...are the Voyager spacecraft.

            They are traveling so fast...

            ...that it's only
            10,000 times slower...

            ...than the speed of light.

            The Voyager spacecraft
            will take 40,000 years...

            ...to go the distance
            to the nearest stars...

            ...and they're not even headed
            towards the nearest stars.

            But is there a method
            by which we could travel...

            ...in a conveniently short time
            to the stars?

            Can we travel close
            to the speed of light?

            And what's magic
            about the speed of light?

            Can't we travel faster than that?

            It turns out that
            there is something very strange...

            ...about the speed of light.

            Something that provides the key...

            ...to our understanding
            of time and space.

            The story of its discovery...

            ...takes us to Tuscany
            in northern Italy.

            There's something timeless
            about this place.

            A century ago, it probably
            looked very much the same.

            If you had traveled these roads
            in the summer of 1895...

            ...you might have come upon a
            16-year-old German high-school dropout.

            His teacher told him that
            he'd never amount to anything...

            ...that his attitude destroyed
            classroom discipline...

            ...that he should drop out.

            So he left and came here...

            ...where he enjoyed
            wandering these roads...

            ...and giving his mind
            free rein to explore.

            One day, he began
            to think about light...

            ...about how fast it travels.

            We always measure
            the speed of a moving object...

            ...relative to something else.

            I'm moving at about 10 kilometers
            an hour relative to the ground.

            But the ground isn't at rest.

            The Earth is turning at more
            than 1600 kilometers an hour.

            The Earth itself is
            in orbit around the sun.

            The sun is moving among
            the drifting stars, and so on.

            It was hard for the young man
            to imagine some absolute standard...

            ...to measure all these
            relative motions against.

            He knew that sound waves are
            a vibration of the air...

            ...and their speed is measured
            relative to the air itself.

            But sunlight travels across
            the vacuum of empty space.

            "Do light waves move
            relative to something else?

            And if so," he wondered,
            "relative to what?"

            That teenage dropout's name...

            ...was Albert Einstein.

            And his ruminations changed the world.

            He had been fascinated
            by Bernstein's 1869...

            ...People's Book of Natural Science.

            Here, on its very first page...

            ...it describes the astonishing speed
            of electricity through wires...

            ...and light through space.

            Einstein wondered, perhaps for
            the first time, in northern Italy...

            ...what the world would look like if
            you could travel on a wave of light.

            To travel at the speed of light.

            What an engaging and magical thought
            for a teenage boy on the road...

            ...where the countryside is dappled
            and rippling in sunlight.

            You couldn't tell you were on a light
            wave if you were traveling with it.

            If you started on a wave crest...

            ...you would stay on the crest and
            lose all notion of it being a wave.

            Something funny happens
            at the speed of light.

            The more Einstein thought about it,
            the more troubling it became.

            Paradoxes seemed to pop up all over...

            ...if you could travel
            at the speed of light.

            Certain ideas had been
            accepted as true...

            ...without sufficiently
            careful thought.

            One of those ideas had to do
            with the light from a moving object.

            The images by which we see the world
            are made of light...

            ...and are carried
            at the speed of light...

            ...300,000 kilometers a second.

            You might think that the image of me
            should be moving out ahead of me...

            ...at the speed of light
            plus the speed of the bicycle.

            If I'm moving towards you
            faster than a horse-and-cart...

            ...then my image should be
            approaching you that much faster.

            My image ought to arrive earlier.

            But in reality
            you don't see any time delay.

            In a near collision, for example,
            you see everything happen at once.

            Horse, cart, swerve, bicycle.
            All simultaneous.

            But how would it look if
            it were proper to add the velocities?

            Since I'm heading toward you, you'd
            add my speed to the speed of light.

            So my image ought to arrive before
            the image of the horse-and-cart.

            I'd be cycling towards you
            quite normally.

            To me, a collision
            would seem imminent.

            But you'd see me swerve
            for no apparent reason...

            ...and have a collision with nothing.

            Now, the horse-and-cart
            aren't headed towards you.

            Their image would arrive only
            at the speed of light.

            Could it seem to me that
            I just missed colliding...

            ...while to you it wasn't even close?

            In precise laboratory experiments...

            ...scientists have never observed
            any such thing.

            If the world is to be understood...

            ...if we are to avoid logical paradoxes
            when traveling at high speeds...

            ...then there are rules
            which must be obeyed.

            Einstein called these rules
            the special theory of relativity.

            Light from a moving object
            travels at the same speed...

            ...no matter whether the object
            is at rest or in motion.

            "Thou shalt not add my speed
            to the speed of light."

            Also, no material object can travel
            at or beyond the speed of light.

            Nothing in physics prevents you from
            traveling close to the speed of light.

            99.9 percent the speed of light
            is just fine.

            But no matter how hard you try...

            ...you can never gain
            that last decimal point.

            For the world
            to be logically consistent...

            ...there must be a cosmic speed limit.

            The crack of a whip is,
            due to its tip...

            ...moving faster
            than the speed of sound.

            It makes a shock wave...

            ...a small sonic boom
            in the Italian countryside.

            A thunderclap has a similar origin.

            So does the sound of
            a supersonic airplane.

            So why is the speed of light a barrier
            any more than the speed of sound?

            The answer is not just that...

            ...light travels a million times
            faster than sound.

            It's not merely an engineering problem
            like the supersonic airplane.

            Instead, the light barrier is
            a fundamental law of nature...

            ...as basic as gravity.

            Einstein found his absolute framework
            for the world:

            This sturdy pillar among all
            the relative motions of the cosmos.

            Light travels just as fast,
            no matter how its source is moving.

            The speed of light is constant,
            relative to everything else.

            Nothing can ever catch up with light.

            Einstein's prohibition against
            traveling faster than light...

            ...seems to clash with
            our common sense notions.

            But why should we expect
            our common sense notions...

            ...to have any reliability
            in a matter of this sort?

            Why should our experience
            at 10 kilometers an hour...

            ...constrain the laws of nature...

            ...at 300,000 kilometers a second?

            Relativity sets limits...

            ...on what humans ultimately can do.

            The universe is not required...

            ...to be in perfect harmony
            with human ambition.

            Imagine a place
            where the speed of light...

            ...isn't its true value
            of 300,000 kilometers a second...

            ...but something a lot less.

            Let's say, 40 kilometers an hour...

            ...and strictly enforced.

            Just as in the real world we can
            never reach the speed of light...

            ...the commandment here is still...

            ..."Thou shalt not travel
            faster than light."

            We can do thought experiments on
            what happens near the speed of light...

            ...here 40 kilometers per hour,
            the speed of a motor scooter.

            You can't break the laws of nature.
            There are no penalties for doing so.

            The real world and this one...

            ...are merely so arranged
            that transgressions can't happen.

            The job of physics is to find out
            what those laws are.

            Before Einstein,
            physicists thought that...

            ...there were privileged frames
            of reference...

            ...some special places and times...

            ...against which everything else
            had to be measured.

            Einstein encountered
            a similar notion in human affairs.

            The idea that the customs
            of a particular nation...

            ...his native Germany
            or Italy or anywhere...

            ...are the standard which all
            other societies must be measured.

            But Einstein rejected the strident
            nationalism of his time.

            He believed every culture
            had its own validity.

            Also in physics,
            he understood that...

            ...there are no privileged
            frames of reference.

            Every observer,
            in any place, time or motion...

            ...must deduce
            the same laws of nature.

            (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN)

            A speed is simply how much space
            you cover in a given time...

            ...as any kid on
            a motor scooter knows.

            Since near the velocity of light...

            ...we cannot simply add speeds...

            ...the familiar notions of
            absolute space and absolute time...

            ...independent of your
            relative motion, must give way.

            That's why, as Einstein showed...

            ...funny things have to happen
            close to the speed of light.

            There, our conventional perspectives
            of space and time...

            ...strangely change.

            Your nose is just a little closer
            to me than your ears.

            Light reflected off your nose
            reaches me...

            ...an instant in time
            before your ears.

            But suppose I had a magic camera...

            ...so that I could see
            your nose and your ears...

            ...at precisely the same instant?

            (SCOOTER STARTS UP)

            (SCOOTER HONKS)

            With such a camera you could take
            some pretty interesting pictures.

            Paolo says goodbye to
            his little brother, Vincenzo...

            -Ciao, Vincenzo.
            -Ciao, Paolo.

            ...and rides off.

            He's now going more than
            half the speed of light.

            He is almost catching up
            with his own light waves.

            This compresses the light waves
            in front of him...

            ...and his image becomes blue.

            The shorter wavelength is
            what makes blue light waves blue.

            Also Paolo becomes skinny
            in the direction of motion.

            This isn't just some optical illusion.

            It really happens when you travel
            near the speed of light.

            As he roars away, he leaves his own
            light waves stretched out behind him.

            Long light waves are red.

            We say that his receding image
            is red-shifted.

            Now Paolo leaves for
            a short tour of the countryside.

            He experiences something
            even stranger.

            Everything he can see is squeezed...

            ...into a moving window
            just ahead of him...

            ...blue-shifted at the center,
            red-shifted at the edges.

            To a passerby, Paolo appears
            blue-shifted when approaching...

            ...red-shifted when receding.

            But to him, the entire world
            is both coming and going...

            ...at nearly the speed of light.

            Roadside houses and trees
            that has already gone past...

            ...still appear to him at the edge
            of his forward field of view...

            ...but distorted and red-shifted.

            When he slows down,
            everything again looks normal.

            Only very close
            to the speed of light...

            ...does the visible world
            get squeezed into a kind of tunnel.

            You'd see these distortions if you
            traveled near the speed of light.

            Someday, perhaps,
            interstellar navigators...

            ...will take their bearings
            on stars behind them...

            ...whose images have all crowded
            together on the forward view screen.

            The most bizarre aspect of traveling
            near the speed of light...

            ...is that time slows down.

            All clocks,
            mechanical and biological...

            ...tick more slowly
            near the speed of light.

            But stationary clocks tick
            at their usual rate.

            If we travel close to light speed...

            ...we age more slowly
            than those we left behind.

            Paolo's watch and his internal
            sense of time show...

            ...that he has been gone from
            his friends for only a few minutes.

            But from their point of view,
            he has been away for many decades.

            His friends have grown up,
            moved on and died.

            And his younger brother has been...

            ...patiently waiting
            for him all this time.

            The two brothers experience
            the paradox of time dilation.

            They've encountered
            Einstein's special relativity.

            Vincenzo.

            This was just a thought experiment.

            But atomic particles traveling
            near the speed of light...

            ...do decay more slowly
            than stationary particles.

            As strange and counterintuitive
            as it seems...

            ...time dilation is a law of nature.

            Traveling close
            to the speed of light...

            ...is a kind of elixir of life.

            Because time slows down
            close to the speed of light...

            ...special relativity provides us...

            ...with a means of going to the stars.

            This region of northern Italy
            is not only the caldron...

            ...of some of the thinking
            of the young Albert Einstein...

            ...it is also the home
            of another great genius...

            ...who lived 400 years earlier.

            Leonardo da Vinci.

            Leonardo delighted
            in climbing these hills...

            ...and viewing the ground
            from a great height...

            ...as if he were soaring like a bird.

            He drew the first aerial views...

            ...of landscapes, villages,
            fortifications.

            I've been talking about Einstein
            in and around this town of Vinci...

            ...in which Leonardo grew up.

            Einstein greatly respected Leonardo...

            ...and their spirits, in some sense...

            ...inhabit this countryside still.

            Among Leonardo's
            many accomplishments...

            ...in painting, sculpture,
            architecture, natural history...

            ...anatomy, geology,
            civil and military engineering...

            ...he had a great passion.

            He wished to construct a machine...

            ...which would fly.

            He made sketches of such machines,
            built miniature models...

            ...constructed great,
            full-scale prototypes.

            And not a one of them ever worked.

            There were no machines of adequate
            capacity available in his time.

            The technology was just not ready.

            The designs, however, were brilliant.

            For example, this bird-like machine...

            ...here in the Leonardo Museum
            in the town of Vinci.

            Leonardo's great designs encouraged
            engineers in later epochs...

            ...although Leonardo himself
            was very depressed at these failures.

            But it's not his fault...

            ...he was trapped in the 15th century.

            A somewhat similar case
            occurred in 1939...

            ...when a group of engineers called
            the British Interplanetary Society...

            ...decided to design a ship...

            ...which would carry people
            to the moon.

            Now, it was by no means
            the same design...

            ...as the Apollo ship which actually
            took people to the moon years later.

            But that design suggested that...

            ...a mission to the moon
            might one day...

            ...be a practical
            engineering possibility.

            Today...

            ...we have preliminary
            designs of ships...

            ...which will take people
            to the stars.

            They are constructed in Earth orbit
            and from there...

            ...they venture on their great
            interstellar journeys.

            One of them...

            ...is called Project Orion.

            It utilizes nuclear weapons...

            ...hydrogen bombs
            against an inertial plate.

            Each explosion providing
            a kind of "putt-putt"...

            ...a vast nuclear motorboat in space.

            Orion seems entirely practical...

            ...and was under development
            in the U.S...

            ...until the signing
            of the international treaty...

            ...forbidding nuclear weapons
            explosions in space.

            I think, the Orion starship
            is the best use of nuclear weapons...

            ...provided the ships don't depart
            from very near the Earth.

            Project Daedalus is
            a recent design...

            ...of the British
            Interplanetary Society.

            It assumes the existence
            of a nuclear fusion reactor...

            ...something much safer
            and more efficient...

            ...than the existing nuclear
            fission power plants.

            We do not yet have fusion reactors.

            One day, quite soon, we may.

            Orion and Daedalus might go...

            ...10 percent the speed of light.

            So a trip to Alpha Centauri,
            4 1/2 light-years away...

            ...would take 45 years,
            less than a human lifetime.

            Such ships could not travel
            close enough to the speed of light...

            ...for the time-slowing effects
            of special relativity...

            ...to become important.

            It does not seem likely
            that such ships...

            ...would be built before
            the middle of the 21 st century...

            ...although we could build
            an Orion starship now.

            For voyages beyond the nearest stars,
            something must be added.

            Perhaps they could be used
            as multigeneration ships...

            ...so those arriving would be
            the remote descendants...

            ...of those who had originally
            set out centuries before.

            Or perhaps some safe means
            of human hibernation might be found...

            ...so that space travelers might be
            frozen and then thawed out...

            ...when they arrive at
            the destination centuries later.

            But fast interstellar space flight
            approaching the speed of light...

            ...is much more difficult.

            That's an objective
            not for a hundred years...

            ...but for a thousand
            or for 10 thousand...

            ...but it also is possible.

            A kind of interstellar ramjet
            has been proposed...

            ...which scoops up
            the hydrogen atoms...

            ...which float between the stars...

            ...accelerates them into an engine
            and spits them out the back.

            But in deep space,
            there is one atom...

            ...for every 10 cubic centimeters
            of space.

            For the ramjet to work...

            ...it has to have a frontal scoop...

            ...hundreds of kilometers across.

            Reaching relativistic velocities,
            the hydrogen atoms will be moving...

            ...with respect
            to the interstellar spaceship...

            ...at close to the speed of light.

            If precautions aren't taken...

            ...the passengers will be fried
            by these induced cosmic rays.

            There's a proposed solution:

            A laser is used to strip
            electrons off the atoms...

            ...and electrically charge them
            while they're some distance away.

            And an extremely strong
            magnetic field...

            ...is used to deflect
            the charged atoms into the scoop...

            ...and away from the spacecraft.

            This is engineering...

            ...on a scale so far
            unprecedented on the Earth.

            We are talking of engines
            the size of small worlds.

            Suppose that the spacecraft is
            designed to accelerate at 1 g...

            ...so we'd be comfortable aboard it.

            We'd go closer and closer
            to the speed of light...

            ...until the midpoint of the journey.

            Then the spacecraft is
            turned around...

            ...and we decelerate at 1 g
            to the destination.

            For most of the trip, the velocity
            would be close to the speed of light...

            ...and time would
            slow down enormously.

            By how much?

            Barnard's Star could be reached
            by such a ship...

            ...in eight years, ship time.

            The center of the Milky Way galaxy
            in 21 years.

            The Andromeda galaxy in 28 years.

            Of course, the people
            left behind on the Earth...

            ...would see things
            somewhat differently.

            Instead of 21 years to the galaxy...

            ...they would measure it
            as 30,000 years.

            When we got back...

            ...very few of our friends
            would be around to greet us.

            In principle, such a journey...

            ...mounting the decimal points closer
            and closer to the speed of light...

            ...would even permit us to
            circumnavigate the known universe...

            ...in 56 years, ship time.

            We would return tens
            of billions of years...

            ...in the far future...

            ...with the Earth a charred cinder...

            ...and the sun dead.

            Relativistic space flight makes
            the universe accessible...

            ...to advanced civilizations...

            ...but only to those
            who go on the journey...

            ...not to those who stay home.

            These designs are probably further...

            ...from the actual interstellar
            spacecraft of the future...

            ...than Leonardo's models are...

            ...from the supersonic transports
            of the present.

            But if we do not destroy ourselves...

            ...I believe that we will,
            one day, venture to the stars.

            When our solar system
            is all explored...

            ...the planets of other stars
            will beckon.

            Space travel and time travel
            are connected.

            To travel fast into space...

            ...is to travel fast into the future.

            We travel into the future,
            although slowly, all the time.

            But what about the past?
            Could we journey into yesterday?

            Many physicists think this is
            fundamentally impossible...

            ...that we could
            not build a device...

            ...which would carry us
            backwards into time.

            Some say that even if we were
            to build such a device...

            ...it wouldn't do much good.

            We couldn't significantly
            affect the past.

            For example, suppose you
            traveled into the past...

            ...and somehow or other prevented...

            ...your own parents from meeting.

            Why, then you would probably
            never have been born...

            ...which is something
            of a contradiction, isn't it...

            ...since you are clearly there.

            Other people think that...

            ...the two alternative histories
            have equal validity...

            ...that they're parallel threads,
            skeins of time...

            ...that they could exist side by side.

            The history in which
            you were never born...

            ...and the history that
            you know all about.

            Perhaps time itself has
            many potential dimensions...

            ...despite the fact that
            we are condemned to experience...

            ...only one of those dimensions.

            Now, suppose you could go back
            into the past...

            ...and really change it by,
            let's say something like...

            ...persuading Queen Isabella not
            to bankroll Christopher Columbus.

            Then you would have set into motion...

            ...a different sequence
            of historical events...

            ...which those people
            you left behind you in our time...

            ...would never get to know about.

            If that kind of time travel
            were possible...

            ...then every imaginable sequence...

            ...of alternative history...

            ...might in some sense really exist.

            Would it be possible
            for a time traveler...

            ...to change the course of history
            in a major way?

            Well, let's think about that.

            History consists for the most part...

            ...of a complex multitude
            of deeply interwoven threads...

            ...biological, economic
            and social forces...

            ...that are not so easily unraveled.

            The ancient Greeks imagined the course
            of human events to be a tapestry...

            ...created by three goddesses:
            the Fates.

            Random minor events generally
            have no long-range consequences.

            But some which occur
            at critical junctures...

            ...may alter the weave of history.

            There may be cases where
            profound changes can be made...

            ...by relatively trivial adjustments.

            The further in the past such an event
            is, the more powerful its influence.

            What if our time traveler had
            persuaded Queen Isabella that...

            ...Columbus' geography was wrong?

            Almost certainly, some other European
            would have sailed to the New World.

            There were many inducements:

            The lure of the spice trade,
            improvements in navigation...

            ...competition among
            rival European powers.

            The discovery of America
            around 1500 was inevitable.

            Of course, there wouldn't be any
            postage stamps showing Columbus...

            ...and the Republic of Colombia
            would have another name.

            But the big picture would have
            turned out more or less the same.

            In order to affect
            the future profoundly...

            ...a time traveler
            has to pick and choose.

            He'd probably have to intervene
            in a number of events...

            ...which are
            very carefully selected...

            ...so he could change
            the weave of history.

            It's a lovely fantasy...

            ...to explore those other worlds
            that never were.

            If you had H.G. Wells' time machine...

            ...maybe you could understand
            how history really works.

            If an apparently pivotal person
            had never lived...

            ...Paul the Apostle or Peter the Great
            or Pythagoras...

            ...how different would
            the world really be?

            What if the scientific tradition...

            ...of the ancient Ionian Greeks...

            ...had prospered and flourished?

            It would have required
            many social factors at the time...

            ...to have been different...

            ...including the common feeling...

            ...that slavery was right and natural.

            But what if that light
            that had dawned...

            ...on the eastern Mediterranean
            some 2500 years ago...

            ...had not flickered out?

            What if scientific method
            and experiment...

            ...had been vigorously pursued...

            ...2000 years before
            the industrial revolution...

            ...our industrial revolution?

            What if the power of this new mode
            of thought, the scientific method...

            ...had been generally appreciated?

            I think we might have saved
            10 or 20 centuries.

            Perhaps the contributions
            that Leonardo made...

            ...would have been made
            1000 years earlier...

            ...and the contributions
            of Einstein 500 years ago.

            Not that it would have
            been those people...

            ...who would've made
            those contributions...

            ...because they lived only
            in our timeline.

            If the Ionians had won...

            ...we might by now, I think,
            be going to the stars.

            We might at this moment have
            the first survey ships...

            ...returning with astonishing results
            from Alpha Centauri...

            ...and Barnard's Star,
            Sirius and Tau Ceti.

            There would now be great fleets...

            ...of interstellar transports...

            ...being constructed in Earth orbit...

            ...small, unmanned survey ships...

            ...liners for immigrants, perhaps...

            ...great trading ships...

            ...to ply the spaces
            between the stars.

            On all these ships
            there would be symbols...

            ...and inscriptions on the sides.

            The inscriptions,
            if we looked closely...

            ...would be written in Greek.

            The symbol...

            ...perhaps, would be the dodecahedron.

            And the inscription on the sides
            of the ships to the stars...

            ...something like:

            "Starship Theodorus
            of the Planet Earth."

            If you were a really
            ambitious time traveler...

            ...you might not dally
            with human history...

            ...or even pause to examine
            the evolution on Earth.

            Instead, you would journey back...

            ...to witness the origin
            of our solar system...

            ...from the gas and dust
            between the stars.

            Five billion years ago...

            ...an interstellar cloud was
            collapsing to form our solar system.

            Most clumps of matter
            gravitated towards the center...

            ...and were destined
            to form the sun.

            Smaller peripheral clumps
            would become the planets.

            Long ago, there was a kind of
            natural selection among the worlds.

            Those on highly elliptical orbits
            tended to collide and be destroyed...

            ...but planets in circular orbits
            tended to survive.

            But if events had been
            a little different...

            ...the Earth would never have formed...

            ...and another planet at another
            distance from the sun would be around.

            We owe the existence of our world...

            ...to random collisions
            in a long-vanished cloud.

            Soon, the central mass
            became very hot.

            Thermonuclear reactions were initiated
            and the sun turned on...

            ...flooding the solar system
            with light.

            But the growing smaller lumps...

            ...would never achieve
            such high temperatures...

            ...and would never generate
            thermonuclear reactions.

            They would become
            the Earth and the other planets...

            ...heated not from within,
            but mainly by the distant sun.

            The accretion continued until...

            ...almost all the gas and dust
            and small worldlets...

            ...were swept up
            by the surviving planets.

            Our time traveler would witness...

            ...the collisions
            that made the worlds.

            Except for the comets and asteroids...

            ...the chaos of the early
            solar system was reduced...

            ...to a remarkable simplicity:

            Nine or so principal planets
            in almost circular orbits...

            ...and a few dozen moons.

            Now, let's take a different look.

            If we view the solar system edge on...

            ...and move the sun
            off-screen to the left...

            ...we see that
            the small terrestrial planets...

            ...the ones about as massive as Earth,
            tend to be close to the sun.

            The big Jupiter-like planets tend
            to be much further from the sun.

            But is that the way it has to be?

            Computer studies suggest...

            ...that there may be many
            similar systems about stars...

            ...with the terrestrials in close
            and the Jovian planets further away.

            But some systems might have Jovians
            and terrestrials mixed together.

            There may be great worlds
            like Jupiter looming in other skies.

            Rarely, the Jovian planets
            may form close to the star...

            ...the terrestrials trailing away
            towards interstellar space.

            Our familiar arrangement of planets...

            ...is only one,
            perhaps typical, case...

            ...in the vast expanse of systems.

            Often, one fledgling planet
            accumulates so much gas and dust...

            ...that thermonuclear reactions
            do occur.

            It becomes a second sun.

            A binary star system has formed.

            From most of these worlds,
            the vistas will be dazzling.

            Not one of them will be
            identical to the Earth.

            A few will be hospitable.
            Many will appear hostile.

            Where there are two suns in the sky...

            ...every object will cast two shadows.

            What wonders are waiting for us...

            ...on the planets of the nearby stars?

            Are there radically
            different kinds of worlds...

            ...unimaginably exotic forms of life?

            Perhaps in another century or two...

            ...when our solar system
            is all explored...

            ...we will also have put
            our own planet in order.

            Then we will set sail for the stars...

            ...and the beckoning worlds
            around them.

            In that day, our machines
            and our descendants...

            ...approaching the speed of light,
            will skim the light-years...

            ...leaping ahead through time,
            seeking new worlds.

            Einstein has shown us
            that it's possible.

            We will journey simultaneously...

            ...to distant planets
            and to the far future.

            Some worlds, like this one...

            ...will look out onto
            a vast gaseous nebula...

            ...the remains of a star...

            ...that once was and is no longer.

            In all those skies,
            rich and distant...

            ...and exotic constellations...

            ...there may be a faint yellow star...

            ...perhaps barely visible
            to the naked eye...

            ...perhaps seen only
            through the telescope.

            The home star of a fleet
            of interstellar transports...

            ...exploring this tiny region...

            ...of the great Milky Way galaxy.

            The themes of space and time
            are intertwined.

            Worlds and stars, like people...

            ...are born, live and die.

            The lifetime of a human being
            is measured in decades.

            But the lifetime of the sun...

            ...is a hundred million times longer.

            Matter is much older than life.

            Billions of years before
            the sun and Earth even formed...

            ...atoms were being synthesized
            in the insides of hot stars...

            ...and then returned to space
            when the stars blew themselves up.

            Newly formed planets were
            made of this stellar debris.

            The Earth and every living thing
            are made of star stuff.

            But how slowly, in our human
            perspective, life evolved...

            ...from the molecules of the early
            oceans to the first bacteria.

            Evolution is not immediately
            obvious to everybody...

            ...because it moves
            so slowly and takes so long.

            How can creatures who
            live for only 70 years...

            ...detect events that
            take 70 million years to unfold?

            Or 4 billion?

            By the time
            one-celled animals had evolved...

            ...the history of life
            on Earth was half over.

            Not very far along to us,
            you might think...

            ...but by now almost all
            the basic chemistry of life...

            ...had been established.

            Forget our human time perspective.

            From the point of view of a star...

            ...evolution was weaving
            intricate new patterns...

            ...from the star stuff on
            the planet Earth, and very rapidly.

            Most evolutionary lines
            became extinct.

            Many lines became stagnant.

            If things had gone
            a bit differently...

            ...a small change of climate,
            say, or...

            ...a new mutation...

            ...or the accidental death
            of a different humble organism...

            ...the entire future history of life
            might have been very different.

            Maybe the line to an intelligent
            technological species...

            ...would have passed through worms.

            Maybe the present masters
            of the planet...

            ...would have had ancestors
            who were tunicates.

            We might not have evolved.

            Someone else,
            someone very different...

            ...would be here now in our stead,
            maybe pondering their origins.

            But that's not what happened.

            There's a particular sequence
            of environmental accidents...

            ...and random mutations
            in the hereditary material.

            One particular timeline
            for life on Earth...

            ...in this universe.

            As a result, the dominant organisms
            on the planet today...

            ...come from fish.

            Along the way, many more species
            became extinct than now exist.

            If history had
            a slightly different weave...

            ...some of those extinct organisms
            might have survived and prospered.

            But occasionally, a creature
            thought to have become extinct...

            ...hundreds of millions
            of years ago...

            ...turns out to be alive and well.

            The coelacanth, for example.

            For 3 1/2 billion years, life had
            lived exclusively in the water.

            But now, in a great
            breathtaking adventure...

            ...it took to the land.

            But if things had gone
            a little differently...

            ...the dominant species might
            still be in the ocean...

            ...or developed spaceships to
            carry them off the planet altogether.

            From our ancestors, the reptiles...

            ...there developed
            many successful lines...

            ...including the dinosaurs.

            Some were fast, dexterous
            and intelligent.

            A visitor from
            another world or time...

            ...might have thought them
            the wave of the future.

            But after nearly 200 million years,
            they were suddenly all wiped out.

            Perhaps it was a great meteorite
            colliding with the Earth...

            ...spewing debris into the air,
            blotting out the sun...

            ...and killing the plants
            that the dinosaurs ate.

            I wonder when they first sensed
            that something was wrong.

            The successors of the dinosaurs
            came from the same reptilian stock...

            ...but they survived the catastrophe
            that destroyed their cousins.

            Again, there were many branches
            which became extinct.

            And had events been
            a little different...

            ...those branches might have led
            to the dominant form today.

            For 40 million years, a visitor
            would not have been impressed...

            ...by these timid little creatures...

            ...but they led to all
            the familiar mammals of today.

            And that includes the primates.

            About 20 million years ago,
            a space time traveler...

            ...might have recognized
            these guys as promising...

            ...bright, quick, agile,
            sociable, curious.

            Their ancestors were once
            atoms made in stars...

            ...then simple molecules,
            single cells...

            ...polyps stuck to the ocean floor...

            ...fish, amphibians, reptiles, shrews.

            But then they came down
            from the trees and stood upright.

            They grew an enormous brain...

            ...they developed culture,
            invented tools...

            ...domesticated fire.

            They discovered language and writing.

            They developed agriculture.

            They built cities and forged metal.

            And ultimately,
            they set out for the stars...

            ...from which they had come
            5 billion years earlier.

            We are star stuff...

            ...which has taken its destiny
            into its own hands.

            The loom of time and space...

            ...works the most astonishing
            transformations of matter.

            Our own planet is only a tiny part...

            ...of the vast cosmic tapestry...

            ...a starry fabric
            of worlds yet untold.

            Those worlds in space
            are as countless...

            ...as all the grains of sand
            on all the beaches of the Earth.

            Each of those worlds
            is as real as ours.

            In every one of them,
            there's a succession of...

            ...incidents, events, occurrences
            which influence its future.

            Countless worlds,
            numberless moments...

            ...an immensity of space and time.

            And our small planet,
            at this moment...

            ...here, we face
            a critical branchpoint in history.

            What we do with our world right now...

            ...will propagate down
            through the centuries...

            ...and powerfully affect
            the destiny of our descendants.

            It is well within our power
            to destroy our civilization...

            ...and perhaps our species as well.

            If we capitulate to superstition...

            ...or greed or stupidity...

            ...we can plunge our world into
            a darkness deeper than the time...

            ...between the collapse of classical
            civilization and Italian Renaissance.

            But we are also capable...

            ...of using our compassion
            and our intelligence...

            ...our technology and our wealth...

            ...to make an abundant
            and meaningful life...

            ...for every inhabitant
            of this planet...

            ...to enhance enormously
            our understanding of the universe...

            ...and to carry us to the stars.

            In our motorbike sequence...

            ...we showed how
            the landscape might look...

            ...if we barreled through it
            at close to light speed.

            Since then,
            inspired by this sequence...

            ...Ping-Kang Hsiung
            at Carnegie Mellon University...

            ...produced an exact
            computer animation.

            This is what you'd see if you
            traveled at ordinary speeds...

            ...through this red and white lattice.

            But this is how it would appear...

            ...if you were traveling
            at close to the speed of light.

            We're probably many centuries away
            from traveling close to light speed...

            ...and experiencing time dilation.

            But even then,
            it might not be fast enough...

            ...if we wanted to travel
            to some distant place in the galaxy...

            ...and then come back to Earth
            in our own epoch.

            Some years after completing Cosmos...

            ...I took time out from
            my scientific work to write a novel.

            A novel about travel...

            ...to the center
            of the Milky Way galaxy.

            I was willing to imagine
            beings and civilizations...

            ...far more advanced than we...

            ...but I wasn't willing
            to ignore the laws of physics.

            Was there, even in principle,
            a way to get very quickly...

            ...to 30,000 light-years from Earth?

            So I asked my friend...

            ...Kip Thorne of the California
            Institute of Technology.

            He's a leading expert
            on the nature of space and time.

            Kip thought about it for a while...

            ...and then answered with
            about 50 lines of equations...

            ...which showed that
            a really advanced civilization...

            ...might establish
            and hold open wormholes...

            ...which we might think of as tubes
            through the fourth dimension...

            ...which connect the Earth
            with another place...

            ...without having to traverse
            the intervening distance.

            Something like crawling
            through a wormhole in an apple.

            I was happy with this result...

            ...and used it as
            a key plot device in Contact.

            But such wormholes through space...

            ...would also be time machines,
            it seemed to me.

            And I used that notion
            in my novel Contact as well.

            Kip Thorne and his colleagues
            later proved, or so it seemed...

            ...that time travel
            of this sort was possible.

            Here, look at this.

            The key question being explored now...

            ...is whether such time travel
            can be done consistently...

            ...with causes preceding effects, say,
            rather than following them.

            Does nature contrive it...

            ...so that even with a time machine,
            you can't intervene...

            ...to prevent your own conception,
            for example?

            Even if time travel of this sort
            is really possible...

            ...it's far in
            our technological future.

            But maybe other beings
            much more advanced than we...

            ...are voyaging to the far future
            and the remote past...

            ...not a measly 40 years ago
            on Earth...

            ...but to witness
            the death of the sun, say...

            ...or the origin of the cosmos.

            If you wish to make
            an apple pie from scratch...

            ...you must first invent the universe.

            Thank you very much.

            Suppose I cut a piece...

            ...out of this apple pie.

            Crumbly, but good.

            And now suppose we cut
            this piece in half, or more or less.

            And then cut this piece in half...

            ...and keep going.

            How many cuts before we get
            down to an individual atom?



            The answer is about
            90 successive cuts.

            Of course, this knife isn't
            sharp enough...

            ...the pie is too crumbly...

            ...and an atom is too small
            to see in any case.

            But there is a way to do it.

            It was here at
            Cambridge University in England...

            ...that the nature of the atom was
            first understood...

            ...in part by shooting pieces
            of atoms at atoms...

            ...and seeing how they bounce off.

            A typical atom is surrounded...

            ...by a kind of cloud of electrons.

            The electrons are electrically
            charged, as the name suggests...

            ...and they determine the chemical
            properties of the atom.

            For example, the glitter of gold...



            ...or the transparency of the solid...

            ...that's made from the atoms
            silicon and oxygen.

            But deep inside the atom...

            ...hidden far beneath
            the outer electron cloud...

            ...is the nucleus, composed chiefly
            of protons and neutrons.

            Atoms are very small.

            100 million of them, end to end,
            would be about so big.

            And the nucleus is 100,000 times
            smaller still.

            Nevertheless, most of the mass
            in an atom is in the nucleus.

            The electrons are by comparison...

            ...just bits of moving fluff.

            Atoms are mainly empty space.

            Matter is composed chiefly
            of nothing.

            When we consider cutting this
            apple pie, but...

            ...down beyond a single atom...

            ...we confront an infinity
            of the very small.

            And when we look up
            at the night sky...

            ...we confront an infinity
            of the very large.

            These infinities are among the most
            awesome of human ideas.

            They represent an unending regress
            which goes on...

            ...not just very far, but forever.

            Have you ever stood between two
            parallel mirrors...

            ...in a barbershop, say...

            ...and seen a very large
            number of you?

            Or you could use...

            ...two flat mirrors...

            ...and a candle flame...

            ...you would see a large number
            of images...

            ...each the reflection
            of another image.

            You can't really see an infinity
            of images...

            ...because the mirrors aren't
            perfectly flat and aligned.

            And there's a candle or
            a candle flame in the way...

            ...and light doesn't travel
            infinitely fast.

            When we talk of real infinities...

            ...we're talking about a quantity
            larger than any number.

            No matter what number you have in
            mind, infinity is larger.

            There's a nice way
            to write large numbers.

            You can...

            ...write the number 1000...

            ...as 10 to the power three...

            ...meaning, a one
            followed by three zeros.

            Or a million is written as
            10 to the power six...

            ...meaning, a one
            followed by six zeros.

            There's no largest number. If anybody
            gives you a candidate...

            ...you can always add the
            number one to it.

            But there certainly are
            very big numbers.

            The American mathematician Edward
            Kasner once asked his nephew...

            ...to invent a name for
            an extremely large number:

            10 to the power 100...

            ...which I can't write out all the
            zeros because there isn't room.

            The boy called it a googol.

            If you think a googol is large,
            consider a googolplex.

            It's 10 to the power of a googol.

            That is, a one followed, not by
            100 zeros...

            ...but by a googol zeros.

            Now, by comparison...

            ...with these enormous numbers...

            ...the total number of atoms
            in that apple pie...

            ...is only about 10 to the 26th.

            Tiny compared to a googol and...

            ...of course, much, much less
            than a googolplex.

            The number
            of elementary particles...

            ...protons, neutrons and electrons...

            ...in the accessible universe...

            ...is of the order of 10 to the 80th.

            A one followed by 80 zeros.

            Still much, much less than a googol...

            ...and vastly less than a googolplex.

            And yet, these numbers, the googol
            and the googolplex...

            ...do not approach, they come
            nowhere near infinity.

            In fact, a googolplex is precisely
            as far from infinity...

            ...as is the number one.

            We started to write out
            a googolplex...

            ...but it wasn't easy.

            It's a very big number.

            Writing out a googolplex is a
            spectacularly futile exercise.

            A piece of paper large enough to
            contain the zeros in a googolplex...

            ...couldn't be stuffed into
            the known universe.

            Fortunately...

            ...there's a...

            ...much simpler
            and more concise way...

            ...to write a googolplex.

            Like this.

            And infinity...

            ...can be represented like this.

            This is the Cavendish Laboratory
            at Cambridge University...

            ...where the constituents of the atom
            were first discovered.

            The realm of the very small.

            From the time of Democritus,
            in the fifth century B.C...

            ...people have speculated
            about the existence of atoms.

            For the last few hundred years,
            there have been persuasive...

            ...but indirect arguments that all
            matter is made of atoms.

            But only in our time, have we actually
            been able to see them.

            Here the red blobs are the random
            throbbing motions...

            ...of uranium atoms...

            ...magnified 100 million times.

            How Democritus of Abdera
            would've enjoyed this movie.

            We pretty much take atoms for granted.

            And yet, there are so
            many different kinds...

            ...lovely and useful at
            the same time.

            Look.

            There are some 92 chemically
            distinct kinds of atoms...

            ...naturally found on Earth.

            They're called the chemical elements.

            Virtually everything
            we see and know...

            ...all the beauty
            of the natural world...

            ...is made of these
            few kinds of atoms...

            ...arranged in harmonious
            chemical patterns.

            Here we've represented
            all 92 of them.

            At room temperature, many of
            them are solids.

            A few are gases.

            And two of them...

            ...bromine and mercury,
            are liquids.

            They're arranged in order
            of complexity.

            Hydrogen, the simplest element,
            is element number 1.

            And uranium, the most complex...

            ...is element 92.

            Some elements are very familiar.

            For example...

            ...silicon, oxygen, magnesium,
            aluminum, iron...

            ...those that make up the Earth.

            Or hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen,
            oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur...

            ...the elements that are
            essential for life.

            Other elements are
            spectacularly unfamiliar.

            For example, hafnium.

            Erbium.

            Dysprosium.

            Praseodymium.

            Elements we don't bump
            into in everyday life.

            By and large, the more familiar an
            element is, the more abundant it is.

            There's a great deal of iron
            on the Earth.

            Not all that much yttrium.

            The fact...

            ...that atoms are composed of only
            three kinds of elementary particles...

            ...protons, neutrons and electrons...

            ...is a comparatively recent finding.

            The neutron was not discovered
            until 1932.

            And it, like the electron and
            the proton, were discovered here...

            ...at Cambridge University.

            Modern physics and chemistry
            have reduced the complexity...

            ...of the sensible world
            to an astonishing simplicity.

            Three units, put together
            in different patterns...

            ...make, essentially, everything.

            A neutron is electrically neutral...

            ...as its name suggests.

            A proton has a positive
            electrical charge...

            ...and an electron an equal,
            negative electrical charge.

            Since every atom is
            electrically neutral...

            ...the number of protons
            in the nucleus...

            ...must equal the number of electrons
            far away in the electron cloud.

            The protons and neutrons, together,
            make up the nucleus of the atom.

            Now, the chemistry of an atom,
            the nature of a chemical element...

            ...depends only on the number
            of electrons...

            ...which equals the number of protons,
            which is called the atomic number.

            Chemistry is just numbers.

            An idea which would have
            appealed to Pythagoras.

            If you're an atom...

            ...and you have just one proton...

            ...you're hydrogen.

            Two protons, helium.

            Three, lithium.

            Four, beryllium.
            Five protons, boron.

            Six, carbon, and seven, nitrogen.
            Eight, oxygen, and so on.

            All the way to 92 protons...

            ...in which case your name is uranium.

            Protons have positive
            electrical charges...

            ...but like charges repel each other.

            So why does the nucleus hold together?

            Why don't the electrical
            repulsion of the protons...

            ...make the nucleus fly to pieces?

            Because there's another
            force in nature.

            Not electricity, not gravity...

            ...the nuclear force.

            We can think of it as short-range...

            ...hooks which start working...

            ...when protons or neutrons
            are brought very close together.

            The nuclear force can overcome...

            ...the electrical repulsion of the
            protons.

            Since the neutrons exert
            nuclear forces...

            ...but not electrical forces...

            ...they are a kind of glue which holds
            the atomic nucleus together.

            A lump of two protons
            and two neutrons...

            ...is the nucleus of a helium atom...

            ...and is very stable.

            Three helium nuclei, stuck together by
            nuclear forces...

            ...makes carbon.

            Four helium nuclei makes oxygen.

            There's no difference between
            four helium nuclei...

            ...stuck together by nuclear forces
            and the oxygen nucleus.

            They're the same thing.

            Five helium nuclei makes neon.

            Six makes magnesium.

            Seven makes silicon.

            Eight makes sulfur, and so on.

            Increasing the atomic
            numbers by two...

            ...and always making
            some familiar element.

            Every time...

            ...we add or subtract one proton...

            ...and enough neutrons
            to keep the nucleus together...

            ...we make a new chemical element.

            Consider mercury:

            If we subtract one proton
            from mercury...

            ...and three neutrons,
            we convert it into gold.

            The dream of the ancient alchemists.

            Beyond element 92, beyond uranium...

            ...there are other elements.

            They don't occur naturally
            on the Earth.

            They're synthesized by
            human beings and...

            ...fall to pieces pretty rapidly.

            One of them, element 94,
            is called plutonium...

            ...and is one of the most
            toxic substances known.

            Where do the naturally occurring
            chemical elements come from?

            Perhaps a separate creation
            for each element?

            But all the elements are made of the
            same elementary particles.

            The universe, all of it,
            everywhere...

            ...is 99.9% hydrogen and helium.

            The two simplest elements.

            In fact, helium...

            ...was detected on the sun before it
            was ever found on the Earth.

            Might the other chemical elements
            have somehow...

            ...evolved from hydrogen
            and helium?

            To avoid the electrical repulsion...

            ...protons and neutrons must be brought
            very close together so the hooks...

            ...which represent nuclear forces...

            ...are engaged.

            This happens only at very high
            temperatures, where particles...

            ...move so fast that there's no
            time for electrical repulsion to act.

            Temperatures of tens of
            millions of degrees.

            Such high temperatures are
            common in nature.

            Where?

            In the insides of the stars.

            Atoms are made in the
            insides of stars.

            In most of the stars we see, hydrogen
            nuclei are being jammed together...

            ...to form helium nuclei.

            Every time a nucleus of helium is made,
            a photon of light is generated.

            This is why the stars shine.

            Stars are born in great
            clouds of gas and dust.

            Like the Orion Nebula,
            1500 light-years away...

            ...parts of which
            are collapsing under gravity.

            Collisions among the atoms heat
            the cloud until, in its interior...

            ...hydrogen begins to fuse
            into helium...

            ...and the stars turn on.

            Stars are born in batches.

            Later, they wander out
            of their nursery...

            ...to pursue their destiny
            in the Milky Way.

            Adolescent stars, like the Pleiades...

            ...are still surrounded
            by gas and dust.

            Eventually, they journey
            far from home.

            Somewhere there are stars formed from
            the same cloud complex as the sun...

            ...5 billion years ago.

            But we do not know which
            stars they are.

            The siblings of the sun...

            ...may, for all we know, be on the
            other side of the galaxy.

            Perhaps they also warm nearby
            planets as the sun does.

            Perhaps they too have presided...

            ...over the evolution
            of life and intelligence.

            The sun is the nearest star,
            a glowing sphere of gas...

            ...shining because of its heat,
            like a red-hot poker.

            The surface we see in ordinary visible
            light is at 6000 degrees centigrade.

            But in its hidden interior...

            ...in the nuclear furnace where
            sunlight is ultimately generated...

            ...its temperature is
            20 million degrees.

            In x-rays...

            ...we see a part of the sun
            that is ordinarily invisible...

            ...its million-degree halo of gas...

            ...the solar corona.

            In ordinary visible light, these
            cooler, darker regions...

            ...are the sunspots.

            They are associated with
            great surges of flaming gas...

            ...tongues of fire which would engulf
            the Earth if it were this close.

            These prominences are guided
            into paths determined...

            ...by the sun's magnetic field.

            The dark regions of the x-ray sun...

            ...are holes in the solar corona...

            ...through which stream the protons
            and electrons of the solar wind...

            ...on their way past the planets
            to interstellar space.

            All this churning power is driven
            by the sun's interior...

            ...which is converting 400 million
            tons of hydrogen into helium...

            ...every second.

            The sun is a great fusion reactor...

            ...into which a million Earths
            would fit.

            Luckily for us, it's safely placed...

            ...150 million kilometers away.

            It is the destiny of stars
            to collapse.

            Of the thousands of stars you see
            when you look up at the night sky...

            ...every one of them is living in
            an interval between two collapses.

            An initial collapse of...

            ...a dark interstellar gas cloud
            to form the star...

            ...and a final collapse
            of the luminous star...

            ...on the way to its ultimate fate.

            Gravity makes stars contract unless
            some other force intervenes.

            The sun is an immense ball
            of radiating hydrogen.

            The hot gas in its interior tries
            to make the sun expand.

            The gravity tries to make
            the sun contract.

            The present state of the sun is
            the balance of these two forces...

            ...an equilibrium between
            gravity and nuclear fire.

            In this long middle age
            between collapses...

            ...the stars steadily shine.

            But when the nuclear fuel is exhausted,
            the interior cools...

            ...the pressure no longer supports
            its outer layers...

            ...and the initial collapse resumes.

            There are three ways that stars die.

            Their fates are predestined.

            Everything depends on their
            initial mass.

            A typical star with a mass
            like the sun...

            ...will one day
            continue its collapse...

            ...until its density becomes very high.

            And then the contraction is stopped...

            ...by the mutual repulsion of...

            ...the overcrowded electrons
            in its interior.

            A collapsing star twice as
            massive as the sun...

            ...isn't stopped by the
            electron pressure.

            It goes on falling in on itself...

            ...until nuclear forces
            come into play...

            ...and they hold up the
            weight of the star.

            But a collapsing star three times as
            massive as the sun isn't...

            ...stopped even by nuclear forces.

            There's no force known that can
            withstand this enormous compression.

            And such a star has
            an astonishing destiny.

            It continues to collapse...

            ...until it vanishes utterly.

            Each star is described by the force
            that holds it up against gravity.

            A star that's supported by
            the gas pressure...

            ...is a normal, run-of-the-mill star
            like the sun.

            A collapsed star that's held up
            by electron forces...

            ...is called a white dwarf.

            It's a sun shrunk to
            the size of the Earth.

            A collapsed star supported
            by nuclear forces...

            ...is called a neutron star.

            It's a sun shrunk to
            the size of a city.

            And a star so massive that
            in its final collapse...

            ...it disappears altogether...

            ...is called a black hole.

            It's a sun with no size at all.

            But on their ways to their
            separate fates...

            ...all stars experience
            a premonition of death.

            Before the final
            gravitational collapse...

            ...the star shudders and
            briefly swells into some...

            ...grotesque parody of itself.

            With its last gasp,
            it becomes a red giant.

            Some 5 billion years from now...

            ...there will be a last,
            perfect day on Earth.

            Then, the sun will slowly change...

            ...and the Earth will die.

            There is only so much
            hydrogen fuel in the sun.

            When it's almost all
            converted to helium...

            ...the solar interior will continue
            its original collapse.

            Higher temperatures in its core will
            make the outside of the sun expand...

            ...and the Earth will
            become slowly warmer.

            Eventually, life will be
            extinguished...

            ...the oceans will evaporate
            and boil...

            ...and our atmosphere will
            gush away to space.

            The sun will become a bloated
            red giant star...

            ...filling the sky...

            ...enveloping and devouring
            the planets Mercury and Venus.

            And probably the Earth as well.

            The inner solar system will
            reside inside the sun.

            But perhaps by then, our
            descendants...

            ...will have ventured somewhere else.

            In its final agonies, the sun
            will slowly pulsate.

            By then, its core will have
            become so hot...

            ...that it temporarily converts
            helium into carbon.

            The ash from today's nuclear fusion
            will become the fuel...

            ...to power the sun near the end of
            its life in its red giant stage.

            Then the sun will lose
            great shells...

            ...of its outer atmosphere to space...

            ...filling the solar system
            with eerily glowing gas.

            The ghost of a star, outward bound.

            Perhaps half the mass of the sun
            will be lost in this way.

            Viewed from elsewhere, our system
            will then resemble...

            ...the Ring Nebula in Lyra...

            ...the atmosphere of the sun
            expanding outward like a soap bubble.

            And at the very center will be
            a white dwarf.

            The hot exposed core of the sun...

            ...its nuclear fuel now
            exhausted, slowly cooling...

            ...to become a cold, dead star.

            Such is the life of an ordinary star.

            Born in a gas cloud,
            maturing as a yellow sun...

            ...decaying as a red giant...

            ...and dying as a white dwarf
            enveloped in its shroud of gas.

            Suppose, as we traveled through
            interstellar space...

            ...in our ship of the imagination...

            ...we could sample the cold,
            thin gas between the stars.

            We would find a great
            preponderance of hydrogen...

            ...an element as old as the universe.

            We would find carbon,
            oxygen, silicon.

            The most abundant atoms in the
            cosmos, apart from hydrogen...

            ...are those most easily made
            in the stars.

            But we would also find
            a small proportion of rare elements.

            Praseodymium, say, or gold.

            They're not made in red giants.

            Such elements are manufactured in
            one of the most dramatic gestures...

            ...of which a star is capable.

            A star more than about one and
            a half times the mass of the sun...

            ...cannot become a white dwarf.

            It will end its life by
            blowing itself up...

            ...in a titanic stellar explosion
            called a supernova.

            There has been no supernova explosion
            in our province of the galaxy...

            ...since the telescope's invention...

            ...and our sun will not
            become a supernova.

            But in our imagination...

            ...we can fulfill the dream of many
            earthbound astronomers...

            ...and safely witness, close-up,
            a supernova explosion.

            Most of stellar evolution takes
            millions or billions of years.

            But the interior collapse that
            triggers a supernova explosion...

            ...takes only seconds.

            The star becomes brighter than
            all the other stars in the galaxy...

            ...put together.

            If a nearby star became
            a supernova...

            ...it would be calamity enough for
            the inhabitants of this alien system.

            But if their own sun went supernova...

            ...it would be
            an unprecedented catastrophe.

            Worlds would be charred and vaporized.

            Life, even on the outer planets,
            would be extinguished.

            In our ship of the imagination, we
            are now backing away from the star.

            But the explosion fragments...

            ...traveling almost at the speed
            of light, are overtaking us.

            Individual atomic nuclei, accelerated
            to high speeds in the explosion...

            ...become cosmic rays.

            This is another way that stars return
            the atoms they've synthesized...

            ...back into space.

            The shock wave
            of expanding gases...

            ...heats and compresses
            the interstellar gas...

            ...triggering a later generation
            of stars to form.

            In this sense also...

            ...stars are phoenixes
            rising from their own ashes.

            The cosmos was originally
            all hydrogen and helium.

            Heavier elements were made
            in red giants and in supernovas...

            ...and then blown off to space...

            ...where they were available
            for subsequent generations...

            ...of stars and planets.

            Our sun is probably a
            third-generation star.

            Except for hydrogen and helium...

            ...every atom in the sun and the Earth
            was synthesized in other stars.

            The silicon in the rocks, the oxygen
            in the air, the carbon in our DNA...

            ...the gold in our banks, the
            uranium in our arsenals...

            ...were all made thousands
            of light-years away...

            ...and billions of years ago.

            Our planet, our society
            and we ourselves...

            ...are built of star stuff.

            We're in a lava tube.

            A cave carved through the Earth...

            ...by a river of molten rock.

            To do a little experiment...

            ...we've brought a Geiger counter...

            ...and a piece of uranium ore.

            The Geiger counter is sensitive to
            high-energy charged particles...

            ...protons, helium nuclei, gamma rays.

            If we bring it close
            to the uranium ore...

            ...the count rate, the number of
            clicks, increases dramatically.

            We also have a lead canister here.

            And if I drop the uranium ore...

            ...into the canister, which absorbs
            the radiation, and cover it up...

            ...I then find the count-rate
            goes down substantially...

            ...but it doesn't go down to zero.

            What's the source of the
            remaining counts?

            Some of them come from radioactivity
            in the walls of the cave.

            But there's more to it than that.

            Some of the counts are due to
            high-energy charged particles...

            ...which are penetrating the
            roof of the cave.

            We are listening to cosmic rays.

            Every second they are penetrating
            my body...

            ...and yours.

            They don't do much damage. Cosmic
            rays have bombarded the Earth...

            ...for the entire history of
            life on our planet.

            But they do cause some mutations...

            ...and they do affect life
            on the Earth.

            The cosmic rays, mainly protons...

            ...are penetrating through the meters
            of rock in the cave above me.

            To do this, they have to
            be very energetic and in fact...

            ...they are traveling almost
            at the speed of light.

            Think of it.

            A star blows up...

            ...thousands of light-years
            away in space...

            ...and produces cosmic rays which...

            ...spiral through the Milky Way
            galaxy for...

            ...millions of years until,
            quite by accident...

            ...some of them strike the Earth...

            ...penetrate this cave,
            reach this Geiger counter...

            ...and us.

            The evolution of life on Earth is
            driven in part through mutations...

            ...by the deaths of distant stars.

            We are, in a very deep sense...

            ...tied to the cosmos.

            Our ancestors knew this well.

            The movements of the sun, the moon,
            and the stars...

            ...could be used by those skilled in
            such arts to foretell the seasons.

            So the ancient astronomers
            all over the world...

            ...studied the night sky with care...

            ...memorizing and recording the
            position of every visible star.

            To them, the appearance of any new
            star would have been significant.

            What would they have made of the
            apparition of a supernova...

            ...brighter than every other
            star in the sky?

            On July 4th, in the year 1054...

            ...Chinese astronomers recorded what
            they called a guest star...

            ...in the constellation of
            Taurus the Bull.

            A star never before seen
            burst into radiance...

            ...became almost as bright
            as the full moon.

            Halfway around the world, here in
            the American Southwest...

            ...there was then a high culture,
            rich in astronomical tradition.

            They too must have seen this
            brilliant new star.

            From carbon-14 dating...

            ...of the remains of a charcoal fire,
            we know that in this very spot...

            ...there were people living
            in the 11th century.

            The people were the Anasazi, the
            antecedents of the Hopi of today.

            And one of them
            seems to have drawn...

            ...on this overhang, protected
            from the weather...

            ...a picture of the new star.

            Its position near the crescent moon
            would have been just what we see here.

            And the handprint is, perhaps...

            ...the artist's signature.

            This remarkable star is now
            called the Crab Supernova.

            "Nova" from the Latin word for new
            and "Crab" because...

            ...that's what an astronomer centuries
            later was reminded of...

            ...when looking at this explosion or
            remnant through the telescope.

            The Crab is a star that
            blew itself up.

            The explosion was seen
            for three months.

            It was easily visible
            in broad daylight.

            And you could read by it at night.

            Imagine the night when that...

            ...colossal stellar explosion...

            ...first burst forth.

            A thousand years ago...

            ...people gazed up in amazement
            at the brilliant new star...

            ...and wondered what it was.

            We are the first generation
            privileged to know the answer.

            Through the telescope we have seen
            what lies today...

            ...at the spot in the sky noted
            by the ancient astronomers.

            A great luminous cloud,
            the remains of a star...

            ...violently unraveling itself back
            into interstellar space.

            Only the massive red giants
            become supernovas.

            But every supernova was
            once a red giant.

            In the history of the galaxy...

            ...hundreds of millions of red
            giants have become supernovas.

            The bit of the star that isn't blown
            away collapses under gravity...

            ...spinning ever faster like a
            pirouetting ice skater...

            ...bringing in her arms.

            The star becomes a single, massive
            atomic nucleus...

            ...a neutron star.

            The one in the Crab Nebula
            is spinning 30 times a second.

            It emits a beamed pattern of light...

            ...and seems to us to be blinking on
            and off with astonishing regularity.

            Such neutron stars are
            called pulsars.

            Neutron star matter...

            ...weighs about a mountain
            per teaspoonful.

            So much that if I had a piece of it
            here and let it go...

            ...I could hardly
            prevent it from falling.

            It would effortlessly pass through the
            Earth like a...

            ...a knife through warm butter.

            It would carve a hole for itself
            completely through the Earth...

            ...emerging out the other side
            perhaps in China.

            The people there might be
            walking along when a...

            ...tiny lump of neutron star matter
            comes booming out of the ground...

            ...and then falls back again.

            The incident might...

            ...make an agreeable break in the
            routine of the day.

            The neutron star matter, pulled
            back by the Earth's gravity...

            ...would plunge again
            through the Earth...

            ...eventually punching hundreds of
            thousands of holes...

            ...before friction with the interior
            of our planet stopped the motion.

            By the time it's at rest at
            the center of the Earth...

            ...the inside of our world would look
            a little bit like Swiss cheese.

            There are places in the galaxy
            where a neutron star and a red giant...

            ...are locked in a mutual
            gravitational embrace.

            Tendrils of red giant star stuff...

            ...spiral into a disc
            of accreting matter...

            ...centered on the hot neutron star.

            Every star exists in
            a state of tension...

            ...between the force that
            holds it up...

            ...and gravity, the force that
            would pull it down.

            If gravity were to prevail, a
            stellar madness would ensue...

            ...more bizarre than
            anything in wonderland.

            Alice and her colleagues feel,
            more or less...

            ...at home in the gravitational
            pull of the Earth...

            ...called one g,
            "g" for Earth gravity.

            What would happen if we made the
            gravity less, or more?

            At lower gravity, things get lighter.

            Near zero g, the slightest motion
            sends our friends...

            ...floating and tumbling in the air.

            Little blobs of liquid
            tea are everywhere.

            Curious.

            If we now return the gravity
            to one g...

            ...it's raining tea, and our friends
            fall back to Earth.

            I've been to a couple of
            parties like that myself.

            At higher gravities, two or
            three g's, say, things get...

            ...really laid back.

            Everyone feels heavy and leaden.

            Except by special dispensation...

            ...the Cheshire cat.

            As a kindness, we remove them.

            At thousands of g's,
            trees become squashed.

            At 100,000 g's, rocks
            become crushed by their own weight.

            At all these gravities, a beam of
            light remains unaffected...

            ...continuing up in a straight line.

            But at billions of g's...

            ...a beam of light feels the gravity
            and begins to bend back on itself.

            Curiouser and curiouser.

            Such a place, where the gravity is so
            large that even light can't get out...

            ...is called a black hole.

            It's a star in which light
            itself is imprisoned.

            Black holes were
            theoretical constructs...

            ...speculated about since 1783.

            But in our time, we've
            verified the invisible.

            This bright star has a
            massive, unseen companion.

            Satellite observatories find the
            companion to be an x-ray source...

            ...called Cygnus X-1.

            These x-rays are like
            the footprints...

            ...of an invisible man
            walking in the snow.

            The x-rays are thought to be
            generated by friction...

            ...in the accretion disc
            surrounding the black hole.

            The matter in the disc
            slowly disappears...

            ...down the black hole.

            Massive black holes, produced by the
            collapse of a billion suns...

            ...may be sitting at the centers
            of other galaxies...

            ...curiously producing great
            jets of radiation...

            ...pouring out into space.

            At high enough density,
            the star winks out...

            ...and vanishes from our universe
            leaving only its gravity behind.

            It slips through a self-generated
            crack in the space-time continuum.

            A black hole is a place
            where a star once was.

            Here we have a flat two-
            dimensional surface...

            ...with grid lines on it, something
            like a piece of graph paper.

            Suppose we take a small mass...

            ...drop it on the surface and
            watch how the surface distorts...

            ...or puckers into
            the third physical dimension.

            Gravity can be understood as
            a curvature of space.

            If our moving ball approaches a
            stationary distortion...

            ...it rolls around it like a
            planet orbiting the sun.

            In this interpretation, due to
            Einstein, gravity is only a pucker...

            ...in the fabric of space which
            moving objects encounter.

            Space is warped by mass into an
            additional physical dimension.

            The larger the local mass, the
            greater is the local gravity...

            ...and the more intense is
            the distortion...

            ...or pucker, or warp of space.

            So, by this analogy...

            ...a black hole is a kind of
            bottomless pit.

            What would happen if you fell in?

            Assuming you could survive the
            gravitational tides...

            ...and the intense radiation flux,
            it is just barely possible...

            ...that by plunging into
            a black hole...

            ...you might emerge in another
            part of space-time.

            Somewhere else in space...

            ...some-when else in time.

            In this view, space is...

            ...filled with a network
            of wormholes...

            ...something like the wormholes
            in an apple.

            Although by no means is this
            point demonstrated...

            ...it is merely an exciting suggestion.

            If it is true...

            ...then perhaps there exist
            gravity tunnels...

            ...a kind of interstellar or
            intergalactic subway...

            ...which would permit you
            to get from...

            ...here to there in much less than
            the usual time.

            A kind of cosmic rapid transit system.

            We cannot generate black holes...

            ...our technology is far
            too feeble to...

            ...move such massive amounts
            of matter around.

            But perhaps someday, it will be
            possible to voyage hundreds or...

            ...thousands of light-years to
            a black hole like Cygnus X-1.

            We would plunge down to emerge...

            ...in some unimaginably
            exotic time and place.

            Our common-sense notions of reality
            severely challenged.

            Perhaps the cosmos is infested
            with wormholes...

            ...every one of them a
            tunnel to somewhere.

            Perhaps other civilizations, with
            vastly more advanced technologies...

            ...are today riding the
            gravity express.

            It's even possible that a
            black hole is a gate...

            ...to another, and
            quite different, universe.

            The lives and deaths of the stars...

            ...seem impossibly remote
            from human experience...

            ...and yet we're related in the most
            intimate way to their life cycles.

            The very matter that makes us up...

            ...was generated long ago and far away
            in red giant stars.

            A blade of grass,
            as Walt Whitman said...

            "... is the journey work of the stars. "

            The formation of the solar system...

            ...may have been triggered by a
            nearby supernova explosion.

            After the sun turned on...

            ...its ultraviolet light poured
            into our atmosphere.

            Its warmth generated lightning.

            And these energy sources sparked
            the origin of life.

            Plants harvest sunlight...

            ...converting solar into
            chemical energy.

            We and the other animals are
            parasites on the plants.

            So we are, all of us, solar-powered.

            The evolution of life is
            driven by mutations.

            They are caused partly by natural
            radioactivity and cosmic rays.

            But they are both generated in the
            spectacular deaths of massive stars...

            ...thousands of light-years distant.

            Think of the sun's heat on your
            upturned face...

            ...on a cloudless summer's day.

            From 150 million kilometers away...

            ...we recognize its power.

            What would we feel on its seething,
            self-luminous surface...

            ...or immersed in its heart
            of nuclear fire?

            And yet, the sun is an ordinary,
            even a mediocre star.

            Our ancestors worshiped the sun
            and they were far from foolish.

            It makes good sense to revere
            the sun and the stars.

            Because we are their children.

            We have witnessed the life
            cycles of the stars.

            They are born, they mature
            and then they die.

            As time goes on, there are
            more white dwarfs...

            ...more neutron stars,
            more black holes.

            The remains of the stars accumulate...

            ...as the eons pass.

            But interstellar space also becomes
            enriched in heavy elements...

            ...out of which form new generations
            of stars and planets...

            ...life and intelligence.

            The events in one star can influence
            a world halfway across the galaxy...

            ...and a billion years in the future.

            The vast interstellar clouds
            of gas and dust...

            ...are stellar nurseries.

            Here first begins the inexorable
            gravitational collapse...

            ...which dominates the
            lives of the stars.

            Massive suns may evolve through the
            red giant stage in only millions of years.

            Dying young, never leaving the
            cloud in which they were born.

            Other suns, longer-lived, wander
            out of the nursery.

            Our sun is such a star...

            ...as are most
            of the stars in the sky.

            Most stars are members of double
            or multiple star systems...

            ...and live to process their nuclear
            fuel over billions of years.

            The galaxy is 10 billion years old.

            Old enough to have spawned...

            ...only a few generations
            of ordinary stars.

            The objects we encounter
            in a voyage through the Milky Way...

            ...are stages in the life cycle
            of the stars.

            Some are bright and new...

            ...and others are as ancient as
            the galaxy itself.

            Surrounding the Milky Way
            is a halo of matter...

            ...which includes
            the globular clusters...

            ...each containing up to
            a million elderly stars.

            At the centers of globular clusters
            and at the core of the galaxy...

            ...there may be massive black holes
            ticking and purring...

            ...the subject of future exploration.

            We on Earth marvel,
            and rightly so...

            ...at the daily return
            of our single sun.

            But from a planet orbiting a star
            in a distant globular cluster...

            ...a still more glorious dawn awaits.

            Not a sunrise, but a galaxy-rise.

            A morning filled with
            400 billion suns...

            ...the rising of the Milky Way.

            An enormous spiral form
            with collapsing gas clouds...

            ...condensing planetary systems,
            luminous supergiants...

            ...stable middle-aged stars...

            ...red giants, white dwarfs, planetary
            nebulas, supernovas...

            ...neutron stars, pulsars,
            black holes and...

            ...there is every reason to think,
            other exotic objects...

            ...that we have not yet discovered.

            From such a world, high above
            the disc of the Milky Way...

            ...it would be clear as it is
            beginning to be clear on our world...

            ...that we are made
            by the atoms in the stars...

            ...that our matter
            and our form are determined...

            ...by the cosmos
            of which we are a part.

            I only have a moment, but I wanted you
            to see a picture of Betelgeuse...

            ...in the constellation Orion.

            The first image of the surface
            of another star.

            But the most exciting recent
            stellar discovery...

            ...has been of a nearby supernova...

            ...in a companion galaxy
            to the Milky Way.

            We are here seeing chemical elements
            in the process of synthesis...

            ...and have had our first glimpse
            of the supernova...

            ...through a brand-new field:
            neutrino astronomy.

            And we're now seeing, around
            neighboring stars...

            ...discs of gas and dust just
            like those needed to explain...

            ...the origin of the planets
            in our solar system.

            Worlds may be forming here.

            It's like a snapshot of our
            solar system's past.

            And there are so many such
            discs being found these days...

            ...that planets may be very common
            among the stars of the Milky Way.

            Can you see me?

            Can you hear me?

            How?

            I could be
            thousands of miles away,

            and yet, when you turn on
            whatever device

            is bringing my image
            and voice to you,

            I'm there.

            Instantaneously.

            How is that possible?

            To our ancestors,

            it would've seemed like sorcery.



            For them, speed of communication

            was only as fast
            as the swiftest horse

            or sailing ships.

            Our messages travel invisibly
            at the speed of light.

            How did we attain
            such mythic powers?

            It all began in the mind
            of one person.

            A child of poverty

            of whom nothing was expected.

            In fact,
            if this man had not lived...

            the world we know
            might not exist today.

            NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:
            Sooner or later,



            someone would've
            likely figured out

            some of his discoveries.

            But if Michael Faraday
            had never lived,

            we might still be living

            as our ancestors did
            in the 17th century.

            Unaware

            of armies of invisible servants
            awaiting our commands.

            This is the story
            of how we learned

            to make electrons
            do our bidding.

            In a way, it begins

            with the greatest genius
            who ever lived--

            Isaac Newton.

            This is Woolsthorpe,
            Newton's ancestral home.

            He walked these fields,
            tormented by mystery.

            Newton, the man
            who figured out the formula

            for the motions of the planets
            around the Sun,

            wanted to know

            how does the Sun make
            the planets act that way

            without touching them?

            How do all the apples
            know how to fall?

            Another genius was puzzled
            by another aspect

            of the same mystery.

            (water splashing)

            (speaking in German)

            You see, son?

            No matter how I turn
            the compass,

            the needle always
            points the same way.

            Except...

            But how?

            They do not touch.

            I didn't hear a
            "Thank you," Albert.

            ALBERT EINSTEIN:
            I can still remember this.

            The experience made a deep

            and lasting impression on me.

            Something deeply hidden

            had to be behind things.

            Between the lifetimes
            of Einstein and Newton,

            there lived another genius,

            one of equal stature.

            The man who solved the mystery
            that stumped Newton,

            also laid the foundation

            for Einstein's
            revolutionary insights.

            And for the way we live now.

            (birds chirping)

            (coughing)

            DEGRASSE TYSON:
            In 1791, in a squalid slum

            in the suburbs of London,

            - (baby crying)
            - Michael Faraday was born.

            He showed
            little promise at school.

            Pray tell us a word that begins

            with the letter R.

            Well?

            Wabbit?

            The word is "Rabbit."

            Once again,
            and correctly this time.

            Wabbit?

            Do you mock me?

            Have I not told you how

            to pronounce the letter R?

            Surely you can at least
            tell us your name?

            Michael "Fawaday," ma'am.

            Take this ha'penny,

            and buy me a cane,

            so that I may give
            your insolent brother

            a proper flogging.

            (door opens)

            DEGRASSE TYSON: History does not
            record that Michael Faraday

            ever attended school again.

            Faraday took his family's
            fundamentalist Christian faith

            to heart.

            It would always remain
            a source of strength,

            comfort and humility for him.

            He was sent to work at
            a bookbindery at the age of 13.

            By day, he bound the books,

            and by night,

            he read them.

            It was the beginning
            of a lifelong fascination

            with electricity.

            After years of working
            in the bookbindery,

            Faraday, now 21,

            yearned to escape
            to a larger world.

            His big break came

            when a customer
            gave him a ticket

            to a sensational
            new kind of entertainment--

            science for the public.

            And it started right here

            at London's Royal Institution.

            Humphry Davy was not only

            one of the leading scientists
            of his day,

            he discovered
            several the chemical elements,

            including calcium and sodium.

            He was also
            a consummate showman.

            And primitive demonstrations
            of electricity

            never failed
            as a crowd pleaser.

            HUMPHRY DAVY:
            May we have

            the lights lowered, please?

            I am about to unleash the might

            of the 2,000 massive
            chemical batteries

            stored in the cellar
            beneath our feet.

            And now, behold the power
            of the mysterious force

            of electrical fluid
            to illuminate our future.

            (crackling, buzzing)

            (audience gasps)

            (applause)

            DEGRASSE TYSON: Faraday was too
            busy taking notes to applaud.

            Faraday created a transcript
            of Davy's lecture.

            Using the skills he had learned
            as an apprentice,

            he bound them into this book.

            Perhaps such a gift would
            bring him to the attention

            of the great man.

            Maybe this gesture
            could be his means of escape

            to a much larger universe.

            Good day, sir.

            I wish you to deliver this
            parcel to Sir Humphry.

            DEGRASSE TYSON:
            It was a long shot, anyway.

            But Faraday hoped
            something would come of it.

            And it did.

            Uh, the experiment
            is ready for you now, sir.

            Ampere tells me that
            poor Dulong lost an eye

            and three fingers
            working with this.

            (screams)

            My eyes!

            My eyes!

            When a chemical experiment
            blew up in the face

            of the world-renowned scientist
            Humphry Davy,

            he remembered Michael Faraday,

            the lad who had gone through
            such lengths

            to copy down and bind
            the transcript of his lecture.

            You have a first-rate
            memory, young man.

            And I shall have temporary need
            of a secretary.

            Sir, I dream of a life
            in service to science.

            I would advise you to stick
            to the bookbinding.

            Science is a harsh mistress.

            Surely, a person of your
            station and modest means

            must have a trade.

            Trade is vicious and selfish.

            Men of science are amiable
            and morally superior.

            (scoffs) I take it
            I'm the first man of science

            you've ever met.

            DEGRASSE TYSON: Faraday made
            himself indispensable to Davy.

            The temporary job became
            a permanent one,

            and the Royal Institution
            became his lifelong home.

            By day, he assisted Davy
            in the lab,

            at day's end,
            he climbed the stairs

            to the little apartment

            where his beloved bride Sarah
            was waiting.

            (thunder crashing, rumbling)

            Humphry Davy and the chemist
            William Wollaston

            were experimenting with
            a mysterious phenomenon,

            one with potentially
            far-reaching implications.

            This is the identical setup
            to Orsted's.

            Now close the circuit, Davy,
            and watch closely.

            (buzzing)

            What could be driving
            the needle away from the wire?

            Damned if I know.

            But it's as if
            the electric current

            makes the wire behave
            like some kind of magnet.

            Electricity must have something
            to do with magnetism.

            Now if we could only get it
            to turn continuously,

            imagine what might be
            accomplished

            if we could put
            these forces to work.

            After you've
            tidied up, Faraday,

            you might see what
            you can make of it.

            (quiet chuckle)

            DEGRASSE TYSON: Davy may have
            been having a bit of fun

            at the expense
            of his young assistant,

            but Faraday was on fire.

            Up to now, electricity had been
            nothing more

            than an entertaining
            novelty toy.

            It could make a light flash
            for an instant

            or turn a compass needle
            briefly,

            but it had
            no practical application.

            Faraday immediately set about
            designing the experiment,

            devoting every moment of
            his spare time to the problem.

            If Faraday succeeded,

            he would be putting
            an infinitely large, invisible,

            and as-yet-undiscovered army
            of electrons

            at the command of human whim.

            How does a revolution begin?

            Sometimes it doesn't take much.

            A piece of metal,
            a bowl of mercury,

            a bit of cork.

            Sarah dear,
            send your little brother down.

            I'm about to try
            something knew,

            and I want him to see it.

            Why don't you do
            the honors, Georgie.

            (buzzing)

            FARADAY:
            There she goes.

            There she goes!

            (buzzing, whirring)

            # #

            DEGRASSE TYSON:
            This was the first motor

            converting electric current into
            continuous mechanical motion.

            Looks pretty feeble, right?

            But that turning spindle

            is the beginning
            of a revolution,

            one that dwarfs
            all the shots fired

            and bombs ever detonated

            in the sheer magnitude of its
            effect on our civilization.

            Try to imagine
            all the businesses,

            industries, technologies,

            transformations
            of the way we live

            that have their beginnings
            in that ecstatic moment

            in Michael Faraday's
            laboratory.

            News of Faraday's invention
            spread quickly,

            and suddenly, Davy's assistant
            was the toast of London.

            Davy didn't take it well.

            He had, after all,
            discovered all those elements.

            Now people were saying
            that his greatest discovery

            was Michael Faraday.

            Davy made sure that Faraday

            wouldn't be making
            any more headlines anytime soon.

            (door opens)

            You sent for me, sir?

            I have a new challenge for you.

            I want you to take
            over our efforts

            to improve the quality
            of British optical glass.

            Those damned Bavarians

            are running circles around us.

            Glass?

            With all due respect, sir,

            I know nothing at all
            of glass-making.

            Then you will learn, Faraday.

            We all know what
            a quick study you are.

            Just analyze the chemical
            composition of their glass

            and work backwards to
            see how they made it.

            It shouldn't take you long.

            # #

            DEGRASSE TYSON: But Faraday
            struggled for four years

            without any success.

            This is even worse
            than the last batch.

            No matter how hard he tried,

            Faraday could not figure out
            what Joseph Fraunhofer

            had discovered years before.

            What Faraday failed to grasp
            was that casting

            perfect optical glass
            for telescopes was a craft

            as well as a science,
            and the masters

            in Bavaria kept their secrets
            under lock and key.

            Faraday never did learn
            their secret.

            He kept a single glass brick

            as a souvenir of this failure.

            Years later, it would change
            the course of his life...

            and ours.

            # #

            Davy's death finally brought an
            end to this fruitless project,

            and Faraday,
            the boy from the slums,

            succeeded him
            as Director of the Laboratory.

            Faraday used his new authority
            to do something unprecedented--

            a series of annual
            Christmas lectures on science

            for the young...
            beginning in 1825

            and continuing to this day.

            # #

            # #

            # #

            At one of the first
            Christmas lectures,

            Faraday enchanted his audience

            with displays of the new powers
            that were at his disposal.

            Suppose I want to fire
            a portion of gunpowder.

            I can readily do it
            with the power

            of electricity.

            (explosion)

            (cheering, applause)

            If I receive electricity
            through this conducting wire,

            I can then give it
            to anything I touch.

            But I must stand on these
            insulating glass legs

            to prevent the electricity
            from going away into the floor.

            (buzzing, crackling)

            Now I am electrified!

            (excited chatter)
            Whoa!

            # #

            Do you think I could light
            this gas jet

            just by touching it
            with my finger?

            No, don't do it! No!

            No! Don't!

            # #

            Now, mind you,
            don't try this at home.

            (whoosh)

            (children cheering)

            And now, my children,
            you have seen for yourselves

            how this invisible force
            of electricity

            can be made to serve
            new purposes

            utterly unattainable
            by the powers we have now.

            (applause)

            (applause continues)

            The invention of a motor
            that could work continuously,

            eliminating countless
            human hours of drudgery,

            would be more than enough
            to make you a fortune

            and land you
            in the history books.

            But that's not how
            Michael Faraday saw it.

            He had absolutely no interest
            in patenting his ideas

            or personally profiting
            from them.

            And as for the history books,

            he had only written
            the first sentence

            of an entry that
            would be many pages long.

            Mr. Anderson, may I ask you
            to dim the lights, please?

            Gentlemen, I am about to induce
            a current of electricity

            merely by moving a magnet.

            Please observe what happens

            in the gap between the wires
            when I do so.

            (buzzing, crackling)

            Do you see how the current only
            flows when the magnet is moving?

            This is the conversion

            of motion into electricity.

            This was the first generator.

            From here, electricity would
            become available on demand.

            Faraday was continuing
            to change the world

            and the way people lived,

            and then, suddenly,

            an illness attacked
            his incomparable mind.

            FARADAY:
            My dear Schoenbein,

            I would be very grateful to
            have your opinion regarding...

            Regarding...

            Dear Schoenbein...
            Regarding...

            My dear husband,
            whatever is the matter?

            I began a letter to Schoenbein

            and could not remember
            what I meant to say.

            This is no cause for alarm.

            You work too hard.

            - You're exhausted.
            - No.

            Sarah, this is different.

            Horribly different.

            It's the third time my memory
            has failed me in as many days.

            I fear I'm losing my mind.

            And what would I be
            without that?

            Why, my darling husband,
            of course.

            When Faraday was 49,

            he began to battle severe
            memory loss and depression.

            His work came to a standstill.

            And although
            he never fully recovered,

            his greatest achievements
            still lay ahead.

            (whooshing)

            DEGRASSE TYSON:
            Faraday

            had immersed himself so deeply

            in electrical
            and magnetic experiments

            that he came to visualize
            the space around a magnet

            as filled with
            invisible lines of force.

            A magnet was not simply
            the magnetized bar of iron

            that you could see.

            It was also
            the unseen something

            in the space around the bar.

            And that something
            he called a field.

            A magnetic field.

            Faraday believed
            in the unity of nature.

            Having demonstrated
            the connections

            between electricity
            and magnetism, he wondered,

            were these two forces also
            connected to a third-- light?

            If he could only show
            a connection

            among these three
            invisible phenomena,

            one of nature's
            most intimate secrets

            would at last be revealed.

            So, what did he do?

            He designed an experiment.

            Faraday knew that light
            can travel as a wave.

            Waves of light vibrate
            randomly in all directions.

            But there's a way to isolate
            a single wave of light.

            It's called polarization.

            When light bounces
            off a reflective surface,

            like a mirror,

            it becomes polarized.

            Faraday wanted to see

            if that single ray of light
            could be manipulated

            by the invisible magnetic field.

            The eyepiece contained
            a crystal

            that acted as a kind
            of picket fence for light.

            Light could only pass
            through it

            if it was somehow moved
            by the magnet.

            He placed a lantern
            before a mirror,

            one that he would only see
            through the eyepiece

            if its reflection could pass
            through the picket fence.

            If this is hard to understand,
            don't feel bad.

            Scientists could not explain
            this phenomenon

            for another 100 years.

            Faraday knew that magnetism
            had no effect

            on light
            that was moving through air.

            But what about when it was
            moving through other materials?

            So what kind of material
            could he use

            to help the magnet
            move the light?

            He tried hundreds of different

            transparent chemicals
            and objects...

            but saw nothing
            through the eyepiece.

            The light was not twisted
            by the magnet.

            He tried crystals of calcite,

            sodium carbonate,

            calcium sulfate,

            and still, he saw nothing.

            He tried acids.

            Sulfuric acid,

            muriatic acid,

            carbonic acid.

            He tried gasses...

            oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen...

            with no success.

            The magnetic field induced

            in these substances
            could not twist the light

            from his lamp back into view.

            (buzzing)
            Damn!

            (gasps)

            In desperation,
            he decided to try...

            the glass brick,

            the souvenir

            of his years
            of bondage to Davy.

            (buzzing)

            It did the trick.

            The force of the magnet

            twisted the light

            so that it could pass
            through the crystal.

            So, what's the big deal?

            Faraday had demonstrated
            the existence

            of the physical reality
            that surrounds us,

            but which no one had ever
            been able to detect.

            It was as dramatic
            a breakthrough

            as seeing the cosmos
            for the very first time

            through a telescope.

            By showing
            that an electromagnetic force

            could manipulate light,

            Faraday had discovered
            a deeper unity of nature.

            He had opened a door
            for Einstein

            and all the physicists
            who came after him

            to glimpse the interplay

            of hidden, primal forces
            in the universe.

            Even as he approached
            the summit of his genius,

            he was plagued by depression

            and doubts about his ability

            to retain even
            the simplest thoughts.

            FARADAY: My dear friend, I find
            a difficulty in answering

            or even acknowledging properly
            a scientific letter,

            for I cannot now hold it
            at once in my mind.

            The memory
            of the parts fail me.

            SARAH:
            P.S. You will be sorry to see

            the tone of this short note,

            but my dearest husband is not
            quite so well as usual,

            but I hope he will improve.

            Yours very truly, S. Faraday.

            As a young man,
            Faraday had risen from poverty,

            in one of the most
            class-conscious societies

            the world has ever known,

            to become the most celebrated
            scientist of his time.

            By age 40, he had invented
            the electric motor,

            the transformer, the generator,

            machines that would change
            everything about the home,

            the farm, the factory.

            Now, at 60, decades after
            the fertile periods

            of the greatest physicists,

            plagued by memory loss
            and melancholy,

            he fearlessly probed deeper

            into the mysterious
            invisible forces.

            The world thought that
            Michael Faraday was a has-been.

            Despite his depression,

            he remained
            as passionately curious as ever.

            Having discovered the unity

            of electricity,
            magnetism and light,

            Faraday needed to know

            how this trinity
            of natural forces work together.

            # this is the way
            the ladies walk... #

            DEGRASSE TYSON:
            This was nothing new.

            Children had been playing
            with magnets

            and iron filings for centuries.

            Everyone had always assumed
            that this lovely pattern

            was just something
            that iron did.

            Faraday knew that electric current
            turns a wire into a magnet,

            so he expected
            to find related patterns

            in iron filings around a wire
            carrying electricity.

            (Faraday whistles jauntily)

            But where others saw merely
            lovely shapes,

            Faraday saw something profound.

            The patterns were not simply
            a quirk of iron filings;

            they existed in the space
            around a magnet

            or an electric current,

            even in the absence
            of iron filings.

            The patterns were the traces,
            the footprints

            of invisible fields of force,

            that reached out into the space
            around anything magnetic.

            The compass needle
            that people wondered at

            for a thousand years
            was not reacting

            to some far away
            magnetic North Pole.

            It was detecting
            a continuous force field

            that stretched
            all the way there.

            Earth itself is a giant magnet.

            And like any other magnet,

            its lines of force
            extend far out

            into the space surrounding it.

            They're everywhere,
            all around us.

            They've always been.

            But nobody had ever
            noticed them before.

            Nobody human, that is.

            (birds squawking)

            Birds are the last living
            descendants of the dinosaurs.

            Pigeons and other birds
            are remarkably good

            at finding their way around.

            They can migrate thousands
            of miles without getting lost.

            How? Partly by recognizing
            familiar landmarks--

            rivers, mountains, stars.

            Even certain smells can serve

            as signposts
            for migrating birds.

            But birds also have
            an inner compass.

            They can actually sense
            the Earth's magnetic field.

            Their brains process magnetic
            data in much the same way

            ours process visual data.

            By sensing the direction
            of the field,

            birds can tell north
            from south.

            That's one way North American
            birds know which way to go

            when they head south
            for the winter.

            The field is stronger
            near the poles

            than it is at the equator,

            a fact that birds use
            to figure out their latitude.

            There are also small
            irregularities in the field,

            locations where the field

            is a little weaker or stronger.

            Just like a distinctive
            mountain or river,

            these magnetic anomalies
            can serve as landmarks.

            For thousands of years, humans
            have used carrier pigeons

            to send messages
            to distant locations.

            It was a crucial method
            of communication

            as recently as World War II.

            When you think about it,
            we've been using

            magnetic fields to communicate
            for a long time.

            We just didn't know it.

            So why does our planet
            have a magnetic field at all?

            What causes it?

            The answer lies
            deep inside the Earth.

            Liquid iron, circulating around
            the solid part of the core

            as Earth rotates,

            acts like a wire
            carrying an electric current.

            And as Faraday showed us,

            electric currents
            produce magnetic fields.

            And that's a good thing.

            Our magnetic field protects us
            from the onslaught

            of cosmic rays, which would be
            very damaging to our biosphere.

            Cosmic rays can rip through DNA.

            Without our magnetic field,
            the rate of mutation

            in living organisms
            would be much higher.

            Fortunately, most of this
            cosmic shrapnel gets trapped

            in the Van Allen belts,
            donut-shaped zones

            of charged particles corralled
            by our magnetic shield.

            Knowing that the Earth itself
            is like a giant bar magnet

            explains one of the most
            beautiful sights in the sky,

            the aurora.

            Charged particles from the Sun,
            the solar wind,

            are constantly bombarding
            the Earth.

            You can think of the solar wind
            as a kind of electric current.

            Our planet's magnetic field

            channels that current towards
            the North and South Poles.

            When it hits our atmosphere,

            the oxygen
            and nitrogen molecules

            in the air glow like
            giant fluorescent lightbulbs.

            When Faraday pursued

            his last
            and most profound discovery,

            the poverty
            of his childhood stymied him

            as it never had before.

            He needed help

            and found it in one who had come
            from another world.

            Michael Faraday
            had solved the mystery

            that baffled Isaac Newton.

            This was how the Sun
            told the planets how to move

            without touching them.

            The Sun does touch the planets

            with its gravitational field,

            and Earth's gravitational field

            tells the apples how to fall.

            (children laughing)

            All this is a dream.

            Unfortunately,
            that was the prevailing view

            among his fellow scientists.

            Faraday was dreaming.

            They admired his inventiveness

            and his genius
            for experimentation,

            but they regarded
            his invisible "lines of force"

            and his ideas about light
            and gravity as hand-waving,

            meaning there was nothing solid
            to back it up.

            Some openly ridiculed
            his theories.

            They needed
            to see his ideas expressed

            in the language
            of modern physics,

            precise equations.

            This was the one area

            where Faraday's
            childhood poverty

            and lack of formal education

            actually held him back.

            He couldn't do the math.

            Faraday had finally hit a wall
            that he could not overcome.

            And then, the greatest
            theoretical physicist

            of the 19th century came along.

            James Clerk Maxwell was born
            into a world of wealth

            and privilege,

            an only child
            of doting middle-aged parents.

            By his early 20s,
            he had made a name for himself

            as a mathematician.

            While other scientists had come
            to think of Faraday

            as old-fashioned;
            a great figure of the past

            but no part of the future
            of physics,

            James Clerk Maxwell
            knew better.

            He began by reading everything

            Faraday had written
            on electricity.

            He became convinced
            that Faraday's fields of force

            were real,
            and he set out to give them

            a precise
            mathematical formulation.

            # #

            _

            An equation in physics
            is just a shorthand description

            of something that can be
            represented in space and time.

            For instance, the equation that
            describes the arc of a pendulum

            shows that it can never swing
            higher than its initial height.

            When Maxwell translated
            Faraday's experimental

            observation on electromagnetic
            fields into equations,

            he discovered an asymmetry.

            See that bottom one?

            It cries out for something else.

            Great mathematician that he was,

            Maxwell added a single term
            to balance it.

            This tweaking of the equation
            changed Faraday's static field

            into waves that spread outward
            at the speed of light.

            It wasn't long before we found
            a way to turn those waves...

            (over speaker):
            into couriers

            for our messages.

            Can you see me?

            Can you hear me?

            This is how.

            This technology has transformed
            human civilization

            from a patchwork of cities,

            towns and villages

            into an intercommunicating
            organism...

            linking us at light speed...

            to each other...

            (cheering)

            and to the cosmos.

            FARADAY: Nothing is
            too wonderful to be true,

            if it be consistent
            with the laws of nature.

            SAGAN: The surface of the Earth is
            far more beautiful...

            ...and far more intricate
            than any lifeless world.

            Our planet is graced by life.

            And one quality that sets life
            apart is its complexity...

            ...slowly evolved through
            4 billion years of natural selection.

            You can describe in detail...

            ...how a rock is put together
            in a single paragraph.

            But to describe
            the basic structure of a tree...

            ...or a blade of grass
            or even a one-celled animal...

            ...you'd need many volumes.

            It takes a great deal
            of information to make...



            ...or even to characterize
            a living thing.

            The measuring rod,
            the unit of information...

            ...is something called the bit.

            It's an answer, either yes or no...

            ...to one unambiguously
            phrased question.

            So to specify whether
            a light switch is on or off...

            ...requires only a single bit.

            To specify something of greater
            complexity requires more bits.

            There's a popular game
            called 20 Questions...

            ...which shows that a great deal
            can be specified in only 20 bits.

            For example...

            ...I have something in my hand.

            What is it?

            Is it alive? Yes.



            One bit.

            Is it an animal? Nope.

            Two bits.

            Is it big enough to see? Yep.

            Does it grow on the land? Yes.

            Is it a cultivated plant? Nope.

            Well, with only five bits...

            ...we've made substantial progress
            to figuring out what it is.

            With 20 skillfully chosen questions...

            ...we could easily whittle
            all the cosmos down...

            ...to a dandelion.

            (BLOWS DANDELION)

            In our explorations of the cosmos...

            ...the first step is to ask
            the right questions.

            Then, not with 20 questions,
            but with billions...

            ...we slowly distill from
            the complexity of the universe...

            ...its underlying order.

            This game has a serious purpose.

            Its name is science.

            Out here in the great cosmic dark...

            ...there are countless
            stars and planets...

            ...some far older than
            our solar system.

            Though we cannot be certain, the same
            processes which led on Earth...

            ...to the origin of life
            and intelligence...

            ...should've been operating
            throughout the cosmos.

            There may be a million worlds
            in the Milky Way galaxy alone...

            ...which are at this moment...

            ...inhabited by other
            intelligent beings.

            What a wonder, what a joy
            it would be...

            ...to know something
            about non-human intelligence.

            And we can.

            Here is an exotic inhabited world...

            ...mostly covered with a liquid.

            We seek the dominant intelligence...

            ...that lives beneath
            its fluid surface.

            This ocean of liquid water
            kilometers deep...

            ...is teeming with strange
            forms of life.

            There are communities
            of transparent beings.

            There are societies of creatures
            which communicate...

            ...by changing the patterns
            on their bodies.

            There are beings that give
            off their own light.

            There are hungry flowers
            that devour passersby...

            ...gesticulating trees.

            All manner of creatures
            that seem to violate...

            ...the boundaries between
            plants and animals.

            There are beings that flutter
            through the ocean like...

            ...waltzing orchids.

            These are a few of the species...

            ...that inhabit the water world
            called Earth.

            They're packed with information.

            Each one has
            a rich behavioral repertoire...

            ...to ensure its own survival.

            But the grandest creatures
            on the planet...

            ...the intelligent and graceful
            masters of the deep ocean...

            ...are the great whales.

            They are the largest animals
            ever to evolve on Earth...

            ...larger, by far,
            than the dinosaurs.

            Their ancestors were meat-eating
            mammals who migrated...

            ...70 million years ago in slow steps
            from the land into the waters.

            Whales, like these humpbacks,
            are still mammals.

            We humans have much
            in common with them.

            Mothers suckle infants...

            ...there's a long childhood
            when adults teach the young...

            ...and there's a lot of play.
            These are mammalian characteristics.

            Vital if an animal is to learn.

            But the sea is murky.

            The senses of sight and smell...

            ...which work well for
            mammals on the land...

            ...are not much use here.

            So the whales evolved
            an extraordinary ability...

            ...to communicate by sound.

            For tens of millions of years,
            the whales had no natural enemies.

            And then, a new and alien
            and deadly creature...

            ...suddenly appeared on the placid
            surface of the ocean.

            (WHALES SINGING)

            These often noisy and occasionally
            deadly objects...

            ...first appeared in large numbers
            only a few centuries ago.

            They are artifacts...

            ...manufactured by land creatures...

            ...whose ancestors last lived
            in the oceans...

            ...350 million years ago.

            (BELL RINGS)

            This particular one, however...

            ...is on a mission of understanding.

            It's called the Regina Maris...

            ...the "Queen of the Sea."

            And one of its jobs is to record
            the sounds of the whales.

            Some whale sounds are called songs...

            ...but we really don't know what
            their contents are.

            They range in frequency...

            ...over a broadband of sounds...

            ...down to frequencies well below...

            ...the lowest sounds the human ear
            can make out.

            A typical whale song lasts
            maybe 15 minutes.

            The longest, perhaps half an hour.

            Occasionally, a group of whales
            will leave their winter waters...

            ...in the middle of a song...

            ...and six months later they'll return
            and pick the song up...

            ...at precisely the spot
            that they left it off.

            Beat for beat.

            Measure for measure.

            Sound for sound.

            Whales are very good at remembering.

            Other times they will
            come back after...

            ...an absence of six months,
            and the piece will have changed.

            A different song will be
            on the whale hit parade.

            Very often the members of the group
            will sing the same song together.

            By some mutual consensus,
            some collaborative songwriting...

            ...the piece changes slowly
            and often predictably.

            I'm not very good at singing
            the songs of whales...

            ...but here's a try.

            In January...

            ...a tiny fragment of
            a long whale song...

            ...might sound like this.

            Whoop. Ahh.

            In February, something like this.

            Whoop. Ahh. Ahh.

            And then in March,
            as maybe you'd predict...

            Whoop. Ahh. Ahh. Ahh.

            One additional "ahh" a month.

            (WHALES SINGING)

            The complex patterns in the songs
            of the whales...

            ...are sometimes repeated precisely.

            If I imagine that the songs
            of the humpback whale are sung...

            ...in a tonal language...

            ...then the number of bits
            of information in one song...

            ...is the same as
            the information content...

            ...of the Iliad or the Odyssey.

            (SPLASHING)

            Is it just a romantic notion...

            ...that the whales and their cousins,
            the dolphins...

            ...might have something akin
            to epic poetry?

            What might whales or dolphins
            have to talk or sing about?

            They have no manipulative organs.

            They can't make great engineering
            constructs as we can.

            But they're social creatures.

            They hunt and swim, fish...

            ...browse, frolic, mate, play...

            ...run from predators.

            There might be a lot to talk about.

            The great danger for the whales
            is a newcomer...

            ...an upstart animal only
            recently through technology...

            ...become competent in the oceans:

            A creature called man.

            For 99.99% of the history of whales...

            ...there were no humans
            in the deep oceans.

            During this period,
            the whales evolved...

            ...their extraordinary
            communications system.

            Some whales emit extremely loud sounds
            at a frequency of 20 hertz.

            A hertz, which is spelled H-E-R-T-Z,
            is a unit of sound frequency...

            ...and it represents one sound wave
            entering my ear every second.

            A frequency of 2000 hertz sounds...

            ...and looks like this.

            (HIGH PITCHED TONE)

            200 hertz, like this.

            (MEDIUM PITCHED TONE)

            And 20 hertz, like this.

            Although your TV set
            may not transmit...

            ...sounds with frequencies
            as low as 20 hertz.

            The American biologist Roger Payne
            has calculated...

            ...that there's a deep sound channel
            in the ocean at these frequencies...

            ...through which two whales
            could communicate...

            ...anywhere in the world.

            One whale might be off the
            Ross Ice Shelf then in Antarctica...

            ...and communicate with another whale
            in the Aleutians in Alaska.

            For most of their history,
            whales seem to have established...

            ...a global communications network.

            What two whales might have to say
            to each other...

            ...separated by 15,000 kilometers,
            I haven't the foggiest idea.

            But maybe it's a love song...

            ...cast into the vastness
            of the deep.

            Now, this calculation on the range
            of whale communications...

            ...assumes that the oceans
            are quiet.

            (WOOD CREAKS)

            (BELL RINGS)

            But in the 19th century,
            sailing ships like this one...

            ...began to be replaced
            by steamships...

            ...another invention of those
            strange land animals.

            Commercial and military vessels
            became more abundant.

            The noise pollution in the sea
            got much worse...

            ...especially at a frequency
            of 20 hertz.

            (ENGINE HUMS)

            The crew of this vessel try
            consciously to keep her quiet.

            But when its engine is on...

            ...it gets very loud at
            a frequency of 20 hertz.

            Whales communicating
            across the oceans...

            ...must've experienced greater
            and greater difficulties.

            The distance over which
            they could communicate...

            ...must have steadily decreased.

            Two hundred years ago...

            ...a typical distance that some whales
            could communicate across...

            ...was perhaps 10,000 kilometers.

            Today, on a typical day...

            ...the corresponding number is perhaps
            a few 100 kilometers.

            We have cut off the whales
            from themselves.

            Creatures which were
            freely communicating...

            ...for tens of millions of years...

            ...have now effectively been silenced.

            And we've done worse than that...

            ...because there persists
            till this day...

            ...a traffic in the dead bodies
            of whales.

            There are humans who gratuitously
            hunt and slaughter whales...

            ...and market the products
            for dog food or lipstick.

            Many nations understand why
            whale murder is monstrous...

            ...but the traffic
            continues chiefly...

            ...by Japan and Norway
            and the Soviet Union.

            We use "monster" to describe
            an animal...

            ...somehow different from us,
            somehow scary.

            But who's the more monstrous...

            ...the whales,
            who ask to be left alone...

            ...to sing their rich
            and plaintive songs...

            ...or the humans, who set out
            to hunt them and destroy them...

            ...and have brought many whale species
            close to the edge of extinction?

            We're interested in communication
            with extraterrestrial intelligence.

            Wouldn't a good beginning be...

            ...better communication
            with terrestrial intelligence...

            ...with other human beings
            of different cultures and languages...

            ...with the great apes,
            with the dolphins...

            ...but particularly with the whales?

            To survive, a whale must
            know how to do things.

            This knowledge is stored
            in two principal ways...

            ...in the whale's genes
            and in their very large brains.

            We can think of their
            genes and brains...

            ...as something like libraries
            inside their bodies.

            The information in the DNA,
            the genetic information...

            ...includes how to nurse...

            ...how to convert
            shrimp into blubber...

            ...how to hold your breath on a dive
            one kilometer below the surface.

            The information in the brains,
            the learned information...

            ...involves such things as...

            ...who's your mother...

            ...or what the meaning is of
            that song we're hearing just now.

            The gene library
            of whales and people...

            ...and everybody else on Earth...

            ...is made of DNA.

            The only function
            of this complex molecule...

            ...is to store and copy information.

            We see here the set of instructions
            in human DNA...

            ...written in a language billions
            of years older than any human tongue.

            Each colored cluster of atoms...

            ...is a letter in the genetic alphabet:
            The language of life.

            There are billions of letters...

            ...many billions of bits
            of information.

            If you came from somewhere
            very different...

            ...you wouldn't be able
            to specify a whale or a person...

            ...in a game of 20 Questions
            with only 20 bits.

            But a game called
            10 Billion Questions...

            ...might just work.

            Every organism on Earth...

            ...contains as its
            inheritance and legacy...

            ...a portable library.

            And the more bits of information
            you have, the more you can do.

            The simplest organism, a virus...

            ...needs only about 10,000 bits.

            Equal to the amount of information
            on one page of an average book.

            These are all the instructions
            it needs...

            ...to infect some other organism
            and to reproduce itself...

            ...which are the only things
            that viruses are any good at.

            A bacterium uses roughly
            a million bits of information...

            ...about 100 printed pages.

            Bacteria have a lot more
            to do than viruses.

            They're not thoroughgoing parasites.
            Bacteria have to make a living.

            What about a free-swimming
            one-celled amoeba?

            These creatures are
            also microscopic...

            ...but in the realm
            of one-celled animals...

            ...they are giants.

            The whales of the microbial world.

            Each contains about 400 million bits
            in its DNA...

            ...the equivalent of about
            80 volumes of 500 pages each.

            That's how much information
            it takes to make an amoeba...

            ...a creature like a small city
            wandering through a drop of water.

            And what about a whale
            or a human being?

            Well, the answer seems to be...

            ...that there's 5 billion bits.

            Five billion bits of information
            in our encyclopedia of life...

            ...in the nucleus of every one
            of our cells.

            So if written out in,
            say, ordinary English...

            ...those instructions,
            that information...

            ...would fill 1000 volumes.

            Think of it.

            In every one of the 100 trillion
            cells in your body...

            ...there's the contents of a complete
            library of instructions...

            ...on how to make every part of you.
            Those cells are smart.

            If this were my gene library...

            ...it would contain everything
            my body knows how to do...

            ...without being taught.

            The ancient information...

            ...is written in exhaustive,
            careful, redundant detail.

            How to laugh, how to sneeze,
            how to walk...

            ...how to recognize patterns,
            how to reproduce...

            ...how to digest an apple.

            If written out in
            the language of chemistry...

            ...what would the instructions...

            ...for digesting the sugar
            in an apple look like?

            Well, let's see.

            Amino acid synthesis,
            polypeptide chains...

            ...transfer RNA, genetic code,
            enzyme expression...

            ...enzyme phosphorylation.
            We're getting warm.

            Hexose monophosphate shunt,
            citric acid cycle...

            Here we are.
            Anaerobic glycolysis.

            Now, eating an apple...

            ...may seem like
            a very simple thing...

            ...but it's not.

            In fact, if I consciously had to
            remember and direct...

            ...all the chemical steps required to
            get energy out of food...

            ...I?d probably starve to death.

            And yet, even a bacterium
            can do anaerobic glycolysis.

            That's why apples rot.
            It's lunchtime for the bacteria.

            They and we and all
            the creatures in between...

            ...possess similar
            genetic instructions.

            Our separate gene libraries...

            ...have many pages in common...

            ...which is another reminder
            of the deep interconnection...

            ...of all living things
            on our planet because of...

            ...a common evolutionary heritage.

            Our present human technology...

            ...can duplicate only a tiny fraction
            of the intricate biochemistry...

            ...which our bodies seem
            to perform so effortlessly.

            But we're just beginning
            the study of biochemistry.

            Evolution has had
            billions of years of practice.

            The DNA knows.

            Now, what if what we had
            to do was so complicated...

            ...that even several billion bits
            of information wasn't enough?

            What if, for example, the environment
            were changing so fast...

            ...that the pre-coded
            genetic encyclopedia...

            ...which may have served us perfectly
            well in the past is now...

            ...not perfectly adequate?

            Why, then...

            ...even a gene library of
            1000 volumes wouldn't be enough.

            That's why we have brains.

            Like our other organs,
            the brain has evolved...

            ...increasing over millions of years...

            ...in complexity
            and information content.

            Its structure reflects all the stages
            through which it has passed.

            The brain has evolved
            from the inside out.

            Deep inside is the oldest part,
            the so-called brain stem.

            It conducts many of the basic
            biological functions...

            ...including the rhythms of life...

            ...like heartbeat and respiration.

            The higher functions
            of the brain have evolved...

            ...in three successive stages
            according to a provocative insight...

            ...by the American biologist
            Paul MacLean.

            You see, capping the brain stem is
            the so-called R-complex...

            "R" for reptile.

            It's the seat of...

            ...aggression, ritual,
            territoriality...

            ...and social hierarchies.

            It evolved some hundreds of millions
            of years ago...

            ...in our reptilian ancestors.

            So, deep inside our brains
            is something rather like...

            ...the brain of a crocodile.

            Surrounding the R-complex is
            the limbic system...

            ...or mammal brain.

            It evolved some tens of millions
            of years ago...

            ...in ancestors who were
            mammals all right...

            ...but not yet primates
            like monkeys or apes.

            It's a major source
            of our moods and emotions...

            ...our concern and care
            for the young.

            And then, finally,
            on the outside of the brain...

            ...living in a kind of
            uneasy truce with...

            ...the more primitive brains beneath,
            is the cerebral cortex...

            ...evolved millions of years ago...

            ...in ancestors who were primates.

            This is the point of embarkation...

            ...for all our cosmic journeys.

            The cerebral cortex...

            ...where matter is transformed
            into consciousness.

            Here, comprising more than
            two-thirds of the brain mass...

            ...is the realm both of intuition
            and of critical analysis.

            It's here that we have
            ideas and inspirations.

            Here that we read and write.

            Here that we do mathematics and music.

            The cortex regulates
            our conscious lives.

            It is the distinction
            of our species...

            ...the seat of our humanity.

            Art and science live here.

            Civilization is a product
            of the cerebral cortex.

            Behind the forehead...

            ...are the frontal lobes
            of the cerebral cortex.

            They may be where we
            anticipate events...

            ...where we figure out the future.

            But if we can foresee
            an unpleasant future...

            ...we can take steps to avoid it.

            Down here in the frontal lobes...

            ...may be the means
            of ensuring human survival...

            ...if we have the wisdom
            to pay attention.

            Inside the cerebral cortex is
            the microscopic structure of thought.

            The language of the brain is not
            the DNA language of the genes.

            What we know is encoded
            in cells called neurons...

            ...tiny switching elements...

            ...every connection representing
            one bit of information.

            How many neurons do each of us have?
            Maybe 100 billion.

            Comparable to the number of stars
            in the Milky Way galaxy.

            And there are something like
            100 trillion neural connections.

            This intricate and marvelous
            network of neurons...

            ...has been called
            an enchanted loom...

            ...where millions of
            flashing shuttles...

            ...weave a dissolving pattern.

            Even in sleep, the brain is pulsing
            and throbbing and flashing...

            ...with the complex business
            of human life:

            Dreaming, remembering,
            figuring things out.

            Our thoughts, our visions,
            our fantasies...

            ...have a tangible, physical reality.

            What does a thought look like?

            Well, it's made of hundreds
            of electrochemical impulses.

            Over there, for example, is...

            ...a spark of a memory.

            Maybe...

            ...the smell of lilacs on a country
            road in childhood.

            And there goes a bit of
            an anxious all points bulletin.

            Perhaps, "Where did I leave my keys? "

            The neurons store sounds too...

            ...and snatches of music.

            Whole orchestras play
            inside our heads.

            The landscape of the human
            cerebral cortex is deeply furrowed.

            There's a good reason for it.

            These convolutions...

            ...greatly increase the surface area
            available for information storage...

            ...in a skull of limited size.

            The world of thought is
            divided into two hemispheres.

            Over there is the right hemisphere
            of the cerebral cortex.

            It's mainly responsible
            for pattern recognition...

            ...intuition, sensitivity,
            creative insights.

            And over here is
            the left hemisphere...

            ...presiding over rational, analytic
            and critical thinking.

            These are the two sides...

            ...the dual strengths,
            the essential opposites...

            ...that characterize human thinking.

            Before us are the means...

            ...both for generating ideas
            and for testing their validity.

            There's a continuous dialogue between
            the two hemispheres of the brain...

            ...channeled through this immense
            bundle of nerve fibers...

            ...which is called
            the corpus callosum.

            It's a bridge between
            creativity and analysis...

            ...both of which are necessary
            if we are to understand the world.

            The information content of
            the human brain expressed in bits...

            ...is comparable to the number
            of connections between...

            ...the neurons in the cortex...

            ...about 100 trillion bits...

            ...10 to the 14th connections.

            If written out in English,
            it would fill 20 million volumes...

            ...as many as in the
            world's largest libraries.

            The equivalent of 20 million volumes
            worth of information...

            ...is inside the heads
            of every one of us.

            The brain is a very big place
            in a very small space.

            Most of the books in the brain are
            up here in the cerebral cortex.

            Down there, in the basement
            of the brain...

            ...are the functions
            that our ancestors...

            ...mainly depended on for survival:

            Aggression, child rearing, sex...

            ...the willingness to
            follow leaders blindly.

            Lots of things that we can still
            recognize in our lives today.

            Of the higher brain functions...

            ...some of them, like...

            ...reading, writing, speaking...

            ...seem to be located in particular
            places in the cerebral cortex.

            On the other hand, each memory...

            ...seems to be stored in many
            separate locales in the brain.

            Old memories are in lots of places.

            Here is one of my earliest memories.

            (POURS LIQUID)

            MOTHER:
            That's a good boy.

            Lunch is almost ready.

            (CLICKS ON RADIO)

            (MUSIC PLAYS)

            That was a long time ago.

            But its imprint has not faded...

            ...in the library of this brain.

            But the brain does much more
            than just recollect.

            It inter-compares.

            It synthesizes. It analyzes.

            It generates abstractions.

            The simplest thought,
            like the concept of the number one...

            ...has an elaborate,
            logical underpinning.

            The brain has its own language...

            ...for testing the world's
            structure and consistency.

            But we never see the machinery
            of logical analysis...

            ...only the conclusions.

            There is so much more
            that we must figure out...

            ...than the genes can know.

            That's why the brain library...

            ...has 10,000 times
            more information in it...

            ...than the gene library.

            Our passion for learning is
            the tool for our survival.

            And unlike the musty bindings
            of our gene library...

            ...in which hardly a word
            changes in a century...

            ...the brain library is
            made of loose-leaf books.

            We're constantly adding
            new pages and new volumes.

            Emotions and ritual
            behavior patterns...

            ...are built very deeply into us.

            They're part of our humanity.

            But they're not
            characteristically human.

            Many other animals have feelings.

            What distinguishes our
            species is thought.

            The cerebral cortex is,
            in a way, a liberation.

            We need no longer be trapped...

            ...in the genetically inherited
            behavior patterns...

            ...of lizards and baboons:

            Territoriality and aggression...

            ...and dominance hierarchies.

            We are, each of us...

            ...largely responsible for what
            gets put into our brains...

            ...for what, as adults,
            we wind up caring for...

            ...and knowing about.

            No longer at the mercy
            of the reptile brain...

            ...we can change ourselves.

            Think of the possibilities.

            The city, like the brain...

            ...has evolved in successive stages.

            The vestiges of its past are
            still retained...

            ...among the constructions
            of the present.

            A city like New York developed
            from a small center...

            ...and slowly grew leaving many
            of the old parts still functioning.

            Some of the major streets
            date to the 17th century.

            Its commercial hub,
            to the 18th century.

            The water and gas works,
            to the 19th.

            The electrical and communications
            systems, to the 20th century.

            The city has evolved
            much faster than the brain.

            Only 10,000 years ago...

            ...the human brain looked exactly
            as it does today...

            ...and we were just as smart.

            But there were no cities...

            ...only a few scattered encampments
            in the vast primordial forests.

            Today, it's just the opposite.

            Forests and grasslands often seem like
            scattered islands in a sea of cities.

            If you were an observer
            from an alien world...

            ...you would've noticed that
            something complicated...

            ...has been happening
            over the last few thousand years.

            It might take you a while
            to figure out the details...

            ...but you would recognize
            by its complexity...

            ...unmistakable evidence
            for intelligent life.

            On closer scrutiny,
            you might recognize...

            ...individual, intelligent beings.

            The evolution of the city is due
            to their conscious activity.

            Millions of human beings working,
            more or less, together...

            ...to preserve the city,
            to reconstruct it...

            ...and to change it.

            It might be more efficient
            if all civic systems...

            ...were periodically replaced
            from top to bottom.

            But, as in the brain...

            ...everything has to work
            during the renovation.

            So the city mostly adds new parts...

            ...while the old parts continue,
            more or less, to function.

            For example, in the 17th century...

            ...you traveled between
            Brooklyn and Manhattan...

            ...across the East River by ferry.

            In the 19th century, the technology
            became available to construct...

            ...a suspension bridge
            across the river.

            It was built precisely at the site
            of the ferry terminal...

            ...because major thoroughfares
            were already converging there.

            When it was possible to construct
            a tunnel under the river...

            ...that, too, was built in the same
            place and for the same reason.

            This use and restructuring of
            previous systems for new purposes...

            ...is very much like the pattern
            of biological evolution.

            Or consider Third Avenue.

            In the 17th century...

            ...you made your way uptown
            on foot or on horseback.

            A little later, there were coaches...

            ...the horses prancing,
            the coachmen cracking their whips.

            And then these were replaced
            by horse-drawn trolleys...

            ...clanging along fixed tracks
            on this avenue.

            Then electrical technology
            developed...

            ...and a great elevated railway line
            was constructed...

            ...called the Third Avenue El,
            which dominated the street...

            ...until 1954, when it was
            utterly demolished.

            Anyway, the El was then replaced
            by buses and taxicabs...

            ...which still are the main forms...

            ...of public transportation
            on Third Avenue.

            Now as gasoline becomes
            a rare commodity...

            ...the combustion engine will be
            replaced by something else.

            Maybe public transport
            on Third Avenue in the 21st century...

            ...will be by, I don't know,
            pneumatic tubes or electric cars.

            Every step in the evolution
            of Third Avenue transport...

            ...has been conservative...

            ...following a route
            first laid down...

            ...in the 17th century.

            But the brain is still more
            conservative than the city.

            If this were the brain, we might have
            horse-drawn trolleys...

            ...and the El and buses...

            ...all operating simultaneously...

            ...redundantly, competitively.

            The vestiges of earlier history
            clearly in evidence.

            When our genes could not store...

            ...all the information necessary
            for our survival...

            ...we slowly invented brains.

            But then the time came, maybe
            tens of thousands of years ago...

            ...when we needed to know more than...

            ...could conveniently be stored
            in brains.

            So we learned to stockpile
            enormous quantities of information...

            ...outside our bodies.

            We are the only species on Earth,
            so far as we know...

            ...to have invented
            a communal memory.

            The warehouse of that memory
            is called the library.

            Libraries also have evolved.

            The Assyrian library
            of Ashurbanipal...

            ...had thousands of clay tablets.

            The celebrated Library of Alexandria
            in Egypt...

            ...consisted of almost
            a million papyrus scrolls.

            Great modern libraries,
            like the New York Public Library...

            ...contain some 10 million books.

            That's more than 10 to the 14th bits
            of information in words.

            More than 100 trillion bits,
            and if we count pictures...

            ...it's something like 10 to the 15th
            bits of information.

            Now, that's more than 10,000 times...

            ...the total number of bits
            of information in our genes.

            Something like 10 times...

            ...the total amount of information
            in our brains.

            If I were to read a book a week...

            ...for my entire adult lifetime...

            ...and I lived an ordinary lifetime...

            ...when I was all done...

            ...I would've read maybe
            a few thousand books.

            No more.

            In this library,
            that's from about here...

            ...roughly...

            ...to about here.

            But that's only
            a 10th of a percent or so...

            ...of the total number of books
            in the library.

            The trick is to know
            which books to read.

            But they're all here.

            What an astonishing thing a book is.

            It's a flat object made from a tree...

            ...with flexible parts
            on which are imprinted...

            ...lots of funny dark squiggles.

            But one glance at it...

            ...and you're inside
            the mind of another person.

            Maybe somebody dead
            for thousands of years.

            Across the millennia...

            ...an author is speaking
            clearly and silently...

            ...inside your head, directly to you.

            Writing is perhaps the greatest
            of human inventions.

            Binding together people
            who never knew each other.

            Citizens of distant epochs.

            Books break the shackles of time.

            A book is proof that humans
            are capable of working magic.

            And this room is filled with magic.

            Some of the earliest
            authors wrote on...

            ...bones and stones.

            Cuneiform writing is the remote
            ancestor of the Western alphabet.

            It was invented in the Near East
            about 5000 years ago.

            Its purpose?

            To keep records.

            Records of the purchase of grain,
            the sale of land...

            ...the triumphs of kings,
            the statutes of priests...

            ...the positions of the stars...

            ...the prayers to the gods.

            This cone was made...

            ...around the year 2350 B.C.

            4300 years ago, there were people
            chipping and chiseling away...

            ...the message on this cone.

            What is that message?

            It's a prayer.

            The inscription on this cylinder...

            ...honors a king.

            Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,
            in the 6th century B.C.

            For thousands of years, writing was
            chiseled into stone...

            ...scratched onto wax
            or bark or leather...

            ...painted on bamboo
            or silk or paper...

            ...but always in editions of one copy.

            One copy at a time...

            ...always, except for
            inscriptions on monuments...

            ...for a tiny readership.

            But then in China...

            ...between the 2nd
            and the 6th centuries...

            ...paper, ink and printing
            with carved wooden blocks...

            ...were all invented,
            more or less, together...

            ...permitting many copies of a work
            to be made and distributed.

            This is Chinese magic...

            ...from the 12th century.

            It took 1000 years for
            the idea to catch on...

            ...in relatively remote
            and backward Europe.

            Just before the invention
            of movable type...

            ...around the year 1450...

            ...there were only a few
            tens of thousands of books in Europe.

            Every one of them handwritten.

            Fifty years later, there were
            10 million printed books in Europe.

            Learning became available to
            anyone who could read.

            Suddenly, books were being
            printed all over the world.

            Magic was everywhere.

            It is 23 centuries...

            ...since the founding
            of the Alexandrian library.

            Since then, 100 generations
            have lived and died.

            If information were passed on
            merely by word of mouth...

            ...how little we should know
            of our own past...

            ...how slow would be our progress.

            Everything would depend on
            what we'd been told...

            ...on how accurate the account.

            Ancient learning might be revered...

            ...but in successive retellings,
            it would become muddled...

            ...and then lost.

            Books permit us to
            voyage through time...

            ...to tap the wisdom
            of our ancestors.

            A library connects us with
            the insights and knowledge...

            ...of the greatest minds
            and the best teachers...

            ...drawn from the whole planet
            and from all our history...

            ...to instruct us without tiring...

            ...and to inspire us to make
            our own contributions...

            ...to the collective knowledge
            of the human species.

            There's a fair number
            of Gutenberg Bibles...

            ...and first folios of Shakespeare
            in the world...

            ...but most of the books
            you see here...

            ...are limited editions with
            very few surviving copies.

            But there also exists in the world...

            ...mass printings
            of paperbound books...

            ...that I think are still
            more wonderful.

            For the price of a modest meal...

            ...you get the history of Rome.

            Books are like seeds:
            They can lie dormant for centuries...

            ...but they may also produce flowers
            in the most unpromising soil.

            These books are the repositories
            of the knowledge of our species...

            ...and of our long
            evolutionary journey...

            ...from genes to brains to books.

            Libraries in ancient Egypt...

            ...bore these words on their walls:

            "Nourishment for the soul."

            And that's still a pretty fair
            assessment of what libraries provide.

            Even at night, the city,
            like the brain...

            ...is busy assimilating
            and distributing information.

            Information keeps it alive...

            ...and provides the tools to
            adapt to changing conditions.

            The long human journey...

            ...from genes to brains
            to books continues.

            Information itself evolves...

            ...nurtured by open communication
            and free inquiry.

            The units of biological
            evolution are genes.

            The units of cultural
            evolution are ideas.

            Ideas are transported
            all over the planet.

            They reproduce through communication.

            They are selected by
            analysis and debate.

            In the last few millennia, something
            extraordinary has happened on Earth.

            Rich information from
            distant lands and peoples...

            ...has become routinely available.

            The number of bits to which
            we have access...

            ...has grown dramatically.

            Computers can now store and process...

            ...enormous amounts of information
            extremely rapidly.

            In our time, a revolution has begun.

            A revolution
            perhaps as significant...

            ...as the evolution
            of DNA and nervous systems...

            ...and the invention of writing.

            Direct communication among
            billions of human beings...

            ...is now made possible by
            computers and satellites.

            The potential for a global
            intelligence is emerging.

            Linking all the brains on Earth
            into a planetary consciousness.

            Elsewhere, there may be brains...

            ...even planetary brains...

            ...but there will be no brains
            quite like ours.

            Mutation and natural selection are
            basically random processes.

            If the Earth were started
            over again...

            ...intelligence might
            very well emerge...

            ...but anything closely resembling
            a human being would be unlikely.

            On another planet with a different
            sequence of random processes...

            ...to make heredity diversity...

            ...and a different environment...

            ...to select particular
            combinations of genes...

            ...the chance of finding beings
            very similar to us...

            ...must be close to zero.

            But the chance of finding another
            form of intelligence...

            ...isn't close to zero.

            Their brains may well have evolved
            from the inside out as ours have.

            They may well have switching elements
            analogous to our neurons...

            ...but their neurons might
            be different.

            Maybe they're superconductors which
            work at very low temperatures...

            ...in which case,
            their speed of thought...

            ...might be 10 million times
            faster than ours.

            Or perhaps their neurons are not in...

            ...direct physical contact
            with each other...

            ...but in radio communication.

            So a single intelligent being...

            ...could be distributed
            among many different organisms.

            There may be planets in which
            intelligent beings have...

            ...not 10 to the 11th neurons each,
            as we do...

            ...but 10 to the 20th
            or 10 to the 30th.

            I wonder what they would know.

            If we could make contact...

            ...there would be...

            ...much in their brains that would be
            of enormous interest to ours.

            And vice versa.

            I think extraterrestrial
            intelligence...

            ...even beings astonishingly
            more evolved than we...

            ...will be curious about us,
            about what we know, how we think...

            ...the course of our evolution,
            the prospects for our future.

            Within every human brain,
            patterns of electrochemical impulses...

            ...are continuously forming
            and dissipating.

            They reflect our emotions,
            ideas and memories.

            When recorded and amplified...

            ...these impulses sound like this.

            (RUMBLING)

            But would an extraterrestrial being,
            no matter how advanced...

            ...be able to read the mind
            that made these sounds?

            We ourselves are far
            from being able to do so.

            But in fact, we have sent
            the very impulses you are hearing...

            ...reflecting the emotions, ideas
            and memories of one human being...

            ...on a voyage to the stars.

            In August and September 1977...

            ...two Voyager spacecraft
            were launched...

            ...on an epic journey to
            the outer solar system and beyond.

            Their scientific mission was
            to explore the giant planets...

            ...first Jupiter
            and its satellites...

            ...and then Saturn
            and its system of moons.

            Close encounters with
            these great worlds...

            ...accelerate the Voyager spacecraft
            out of the solar system.

            As an incidental consequence
            of their trajectories...

            ...they will be carried inexorably
            into the realm of the stars...

            ...where they will wander forever.

            The ships will be slightly eroded
            within the solar system...

            ...by micrometeorites,
            planetary rings systems...

            ...and radiation belts.

            But once past the planets...

            ...they will endure
            for a billion years...

            ...in the cold vacuum
            of interstellar space.

            Perhaps in the distant future...

            ...beings of an alien civilization
            will intercept these ships.

            They'll examine our spacecraft...

            ...and understand much about
            our science and technology.

            But a machine alone can tell
            only so much about its makers.

            So each bears a golden
            phonograph record...

            ...with not only the brain waves
            of a woman from Earth...

            ...but also an anthology of music,
            pictures and sounds of our planet...

            ...including greetings
            in 60 human languages...

            ...and the salutations
            of the humpback whales.

            The record cover bears instructions
            on how to hear the sounds...

            ...and see the pictures
            encoded on the disk.

            Including some snapshots
            from the family album...

            ...of a distant world.

            The Voyager record is
            a message in a bottle...

            ...cast into the cosmic ocean.

            It contains some of our thoughts
            and our feelings...

            ...something of the information
            we store...

            ...in genes and brains and books.

            The recipients, if any...

            ...will understand the pictures
            and sounds incompletely at best.

            But one thing would
            be clear about us:

            No one sends such a message
            on such a journey...

            ...without a positive passion
            for the future.

            For all the possible vagaries
            of the message...

            ...they will be sure that
            we were a species endowed...

            ...with hope and perseverance,
            at least a little intelligence...

            ...and a longing to make
            contact with the cosmos.

            SAGAN:
            In the vastness of the cosmos...

            ...there must be other civilizations
            far older...

            ...and more advanced than ours.

            So shouldn't we have been visited?
            Shouldn't there be...

            ...alien ships in the skies of Earth?

            There's nothing impossible
            in this idea.

            And no one would be happier than me
            if we were visited.

            But has it happened in fact?

            What counts is not what's plausible,
            not what we'd like to believe...

            ...not what one or two witnesses
            claim.

            But only what is supported
            by hard evidence...



            ...rigorously and skeptically
            examined.

            Extraordinary claims
            require extraordinary evidence.

            Since 1947, there have been hundreds
            of thousands of reports of UFOs:

            Unidentified flying objects.

            This subject has...

            ...more to do with religion and
            superstition than with science.

            Let's consider one of the most famous
            accounts of a supposed encounter...

            ...with alien beings.

            On September 19, 1961...

            ...an American couple was driving home
            through New Hampshire.

            What's the matter, Delsey?

            SAGAN: They were returning along
            a lonely road, late at night...

            ...from a vacation in Canada.

            Remember, we have only their word
            for what happened next.



            (TUNES RADIO)

            (STATIC FROM RADIO)

            I'm only getting static.

            You still don't believe it, do you?

            No, I don't. There must be
            a reasonable explanation.

            Oh!

            SAGAN:
            They had observed, so they said...

            ...a strange moving light in the sky.

            By definition,
            an unidentified flying object.

            It seemed to follow them for miles.

            Easy there.

            What's the matter with that dog?

            (HUMMING NOISE)

            What's that sound?

            I don't know.

            After a time, the lighting patterns
            on the UFO changed.

            It appeared to land.

            What the...

            It blocked the road,
            preventing them from driving on.

            They said they saw
            mouthless creatures approaching...

            ...who were not exactly human.

            Barney!

            Barney, what is that?

            At this point, the story
            becomes still stranger.

            They lost all recollection of what
            happened in the next few hours.

            But weeks later, they said...

            ...they recalled some details and
            discussed the experience with others.

            26 months later, under hypnosis...

            ...they reported that
            a UFO had landed...

            ...and that the crew had emerged.

            They were captured, they said,
            and taken aboard the craft.

            (WHINES)

            That was the story told by
            Betty and Barney Hill.

            Virtually all scientists
            who've studied it are skeptical.

            But UFO enthusiasts think
            the Hill case is a classic example...

            ...of a "close encounter
            of the third kind."

            Why? What makes it so special?

            While on board, Betty had noticed...

            ...a book written in an unknown
            hieroglyphic writing.

            She was also shown a strange window
            through which she could see...

            ...a glowing pattern of dots
            connected with lines.

            It was, they told her, a star map...

            ...displaying the routes
            of interstellar commerce.

            Afterwards, they were released
            and permitted to return home.

            Or at least, this is their story.

            Believers find this compelling,
            or at least plausible...

            ...chiefly because of
            the alleged star map.

            Here's how Betty said it looked.

            Why would we take this seriously?

            Because here is a real map widely
            publicized by UFO enthusiasts...

            ...of 15 selected nearby stars,
            including the sun...

            ...as seen from one particular
            vantage point in space.

            This map includes stars...

            ...that were first cataloged
            several years after...

            ...Betty Hill recalled what she says
            she saw in the alien ship.

            Her map required, we are told...

            ...information that wasn't
            available on Earth.

            There is a resemblance between
            the two maps, but that's because...

            ...the lines corresponding
            to navigation routes...

            ...have been copied from the Hill map
            onto the real star map.

            If we were to substitute
            some other set of lines...

            ...for the Hill lines, we find that
            the eye suddenly is biased...

            ...against seeing any agreement
            between the two maps at all.

            To make an objective test, however,
            let's remove the lines altogether.

            And then there's very little
            resemblance left.

            But these particular stars...

            ...are selected from a large catalog
            of star positions.

            Our vantage point is also
            selected to make the best...

            ...possible fit with the Hill map.

            If you can pick and choose
            from a large number of stars...

            ...viewed from any vantage point
            in space...

            ...you can always find a resemblance
            to the pattern you're looking for.

            I'm surprised that nobody found...

            ...a better fit to the Hill map.

            The Hills' own psychiatrist described
            their story as a kind of dream.

            There's no corroborating evidence.
            The star map argument is worthless.

            And yet this is one of
            the best attested cases...

            ...of UFO close encounters.

            For all I know, we're visited...

            ...by a different extraterrestrial
            civilization every second Tuesday.

            But there's no support
            for this appealing idea.

            The extraordinary claims are not
            supported by extraordinary evidence.

            There are curious daylight photos
            of UFOs.

            Some look suspiciously like...

            ...hats or hubcaps thrown
            into the air.

            Photos can be faked.

            More common are unidentified
            lights at night.

            They're often aircraft.

            But if we can't identify a light,
            that doesn't make it a spaceship.

            Here's a movie of what
            you might think is a UFO.

            Actually it's a piece
            of an asteroid burning up...

            ...as it enters the Earth's
            atmosphere.

            Most reports of UFOs turn out
            to be something else, like...

            ...the refracted image of a planet or
            re-entry of an artificial satellite.

            Some are psychological aberrations.
            Some are hoaxes.

            Never is there any compelling
            physical evidence...

            ...a detailed close-up photograph
            of a strange spacecraft...

            ...or a small device of
            extraterrestrial manufacture...

            ...or a book written in
            alien hieroglyphics.

            Never.

            There are reports of such things,
            but never the things themselves.

            The search for alien civilizations
            retains its importance despite...

            ...the striking failure
            of the UFO evidence.

            Most astronomers consider
            extraterrestrial life...

            ...a subject worthy of vigorous,
            if cautious, pursuit.

            For myself, I find something
            irresistible in the idea of...

            ...discovering a token,
            maybe a simple inscription...

            ...which would provide the key to
            understanding an alien civilization.

            This is an appeal we humans
            have felt before.

            In 1801...

            ...a famous physicist was governor
            of the French province of Is?re.

            His name was Joseph Fourier.

            On an inspection of the schools
            in his province...

            ...Fourier discovered an exceptional
            11-year-old boy:

            Jean Francois Champollion.

            The boy's precocious intellect and
            remarkable flair for languages...

            ...had earned him the admiration
            of local scholars.

            Fourier too was impressed.

            What Champollion first saw
            in Fourier's house...

            ...determined the course
            of his life...

            ...and unlocked the secrets
            of an alien civilization.

            Fourier had recently participated,
            as one of many scientists...

            ...in Napoleon's expedition
            to the Middle East.

            He had been in charge of cataloging
            the astronomical monuments of Egypt.

            The boy was entranced by
            Fourier's collection...

            ...of ancient Egyptian artifacts:

            The mysterious fragments
            of a lost world.

            France at this time was flooded
            with such artifacts...

            ...plundered by Napoleon...

            ...and now arousing intense interest
            among scholars and the general public.

            His attention was caught...

            ...by a specimen of
            Egyptian hieroglyphics.

            "What do they mean? " he asked.

            "Nobody knows," was Fourier's reply.

            Then and there,
            Champollion resolved...

            ...he would understand this language
            no one could read...

            ...he would decode the messages
            from another world and another time.

            He became a superb linguist and
            immersed himself in the hieroglyphics.

            Fourier edited the illustrated
            description of Napoleon's expedition.

            The young Champollion
            studied it hungrily.

            To the people of Europe...

            ...these exotic images revealed
            an utterly alien civilization...

            ...a world of towering monuments
            and magical names.

            Dendera.

            Karnak.

            Luxor.

            Every illustration was a riddle
            posed by the past to the present.

            And among them were pictures of
            something called the Rosetta Stone...

            ...and portraits of the people who
            lived among the ruins of the pharaohs.

            Egypt became the land of
            Champollion's dreams.

            But it was not until 1828...

            ...27 years after his fateful
            visit with Fourier...

            ...that Champollion
            first set foot in Egypt.

            With his companions, Champollion
            chartered boats in Cairo...

            ...and sailed slowly upstream...

            ...following the course of the Nile.

            It was a journey of many weeks...

            ...which Champollion recorded
            in extraordinary detail.

            This was an expedition through time...

            ...a voyage across the centuries...

            ...to another world.

            Champollion, as an adult...

            ...had worked out a brilliant
            decipherment of the hieroglyphics.

            A word, incidentally,
            that means "sacred carvings."

            Now Champollion was making
            a pilgrimage...

            ...to the scene of ancient mysteries
            he had been the first to understand.

            Champollion wrote:

            "The evening of the 16th,
            we finally arrived at Dendera.

            We were only an hour away
            from the temples.

            Could we resist the temptation?

            I ask the coldest of you mortals!

            To dine and leave immediately
            were the orders of the moment.

            Alone and without guides,
            we crossed the fields.

            Presuming that the temples were
            in a straight line from our boat...

            ...we walked thus for an hour and
            a half without finding anything.

            We discovered a man who put us
            on the correct route...

            ...and ended up walking with us
            with good graces.

            The temple appeared to us at last.

            I shall not try to describe
            the impression which the porches...

            ...and above all,
            the portico made on us.

            We stayed there two hours
            in ecstasy...

            ...running through the huge rooms
            and trying to read...

            ...the exterior inscriptions
            in the moonlight."

            It was with no small rapture
            that Champollion...

            ...entered the secret places of
            the temple and scanned the words...

            ...that had waited patiently
            through half a million nights...

            ...for a reader.

            To his brother, Champollion
            wrote of his joy...

            ...in confirming that he could
            understand the writing on these walls.

            "I am now proud," he said...

            "...that having followed
            the course of the Nile...

            ...I have the right to announce there
            is nothing to modify in our letter...

            ...on the alphabet of hieroglyphics.

            Our alphabet is good.

            It is applicable with the same
            success, first of all...

            ...in Egyptian monuments of
            the Roman epoch...

            ...and, which is more interesting...

            ...to the inscriptions on all
            temples, palaces and tombs...

            ...of the Pharaonic epoch."

            Champollion was overwhelmed by
            the grandeur which surrounded him.

            "It is the union," he said...

            "...of grace and majesty
            in the highest degree.

            We in Europe are only dwafts.

            No nation, ancient or modern, has
            conceived the art of architecture...

            ...on such a sublime, great
            and imposing style...

            ...as the ancient Egyptians.

            They ordered everything to be done
            for people who are 100 feet high."

            This is the great temple of Karnak...

            ...in upper Egypt...

            ...continuously constructed over
            a period of more than 2,000 years...

            ...until the time of Ptolemy.

            It was here Champollion wrote:

            "That all the Pharaonic magnificence
            appeared to me."

            What he had seen elsewhere, he said...

            ..."Seemed to me, miserable...

            ...compared with the colossal
            conceptions around me."

            On these walls and columns
            at Karnak...

            ...at Dendera and everywhere else
            in Egypt...

            ...Champollion found that
            he could read inscriptions...

            ...that his decipherment of a few
            years earlier had been correct.

            But how had he figured it out?

            Many had tried and failed
            to read the hieroglyphics.

            A group of scholars thought they were
            a picture code full of metaphors...

            ...mostly about eyeballs,
            wavy lines and animals.

            Birds, especially birds,
            lots of birds.

            Some deduced that the Egyptians
            had been colonists from China.

            There were those who deduced it
            the other way around.

            There's one who, from one look at the
            Rosetta Stone, deduced its meaning.

            He said that the quickness
            of his decipherment...

            ...enabled him "to avoid
            the systematic errors...

            ...which invariably arise
            from prolonged reflection."

            You get better results, he's saying,
            if you don't think about it too much.

            As in the search for
            extraterrestrial intelligence today...

            ...the unbridled speculation
            by amateurs...

            ...served to frighten many
            professionals right out of the field.

            Champollion was not frightened.

            He was also not distracted
            by the idea...

            ...of hieroglyphs as
            pictorial metaphors.

            Instead...

            ...using the insights of a brilliant
            English physicist, Thomas Young...

            ...he proceeded something like this:

            This is an exact replica
            of the Rosetta Stone.

            The original had been found
            in the year 1799...

            ...by a French soldier working
            on the fortifications...

            ...of the Nile delta town of Rashid...

            ...which the Europeans, in their
            persistence not to learn Arabic...

            ...called "Rosetta."

            It had been part of an ancient temple
            which had been torn down.

            If we look at it,
            we see that it clearly...

            ...represents the same text
            in three different languages.

            Up at the top,
            ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

            In the middle, a kind of cursive...

            ...and later hieroglyphic
            called "Demotic."

            And down at the bottom,
            the key to the enterprise: Greek.

            Champollion could read ancient Greek,
            he was a superb linguist...

            ...and discovered that this stone
            had been inscribed...

            ...to commemorate the coronation...

            ...of King Ptolemy V
            Epiphanes...

            ...in the spring of the year 196 B.C.

            As expected, the Greek text includes
            many references to King Ptolemy.

            Here you can see it.

            "Ptolemaeus."

            In roughly the same positions
            but in the hieroglyphic text...

            ...are these ovals or "cartouches"
            as they are called.

            And if this cartouche really
            means "Ptolemy"...

            ...the individual hieroglyphs are not
            likely to be pictograms or metaphors.

            Much more likely, they're letters
            or at least syllables.

            Champollion had the presence
            of mind...

            ...to count up the number
            of Greek words...

            ...and the number of
            individual hieroglyphics...

            ...in what are presumably
            equivalent texts.

            He found that the number of
            individual hieroglyphs...

            ...is much larger than the number
            of Greek words...

            ...again implying that the hieroglyphs
            are mainly letters and syllables.

            But which hieroglyphs correspond
            to which letters?

            Fortunately, Champollion had available
            a kind of second Rosetta Stone...

            ...an obelisk which had been excavated
            at the temple of Philae...

            ...and which had inscribed upon it...

            ...cartouches representing
            the hieroglyphic equivalent...

            ...of another Greek name: Cleopatra.

            So here we have
            the Cleopatra cartouche.

            And here, the Ptolemaeus cartouche.

            Here, we've turned it around,
            changing left to right...

            ...to right to left, and spread the
            hieroglyphs out so we see them all.

            Now, immediately we notice that
            there are some similarities.

            This first hieroglyph in Ptolemy
            is a kind of square.

            The fifth hieroglyph in Cleopatra
            is a square.

            But "Cleopatra"...

            Both of them seem to represent a "p."

            So Ptolemy and Cleopatra...

            ...both give us
            the same interpretation:

            A square is a "p."

            Likewise, the fourth hieroglyph...

            ...in Ptolemy is a lion.

            "P-t-o-I."

            Likewise, the second hieroglyph
            in Cleopatra is an "I."

            So again it's consistent.
            The pattern is emerging.

            Likewise, this rope or
            hangman's noose...

            ..."Ptolemy." It's an "o."

            "Cleopatra." It's an "o."

            And in this way, Champollion
            was able to assign...

            ...letters for each of
            the hieroglyphs we see here.

            "Ptolemaeus."

            And, likewise...

            ..."Cleopatra."

            The eagle is an "a."

            Notice there are two different
            symbols for "t."

            But in English, the same sort
            of thing, "f" and "ph."

            Champollion discovered that
            the hieroglyphics...

            ...were a simple substitution cipher.

            Now, there's other stuff in here.

            All the rest of this:
            What's that about?

            Well, he was later able to find out...

            ...this is a symbol called
            the "ankh" which means "life."

            There's a "pt." That's an "ah."
            It makes "Ptah"...

            ...name of a god.

            And the whole cartouche read:

            "Ptolemy, ever living...

            ...beloved of the god, Ptah."

            And the end of the "Cleopatra"
            is a short form...

            ...meaning "Daughter of Isis."

            So it turns out that Champollion's
            opponents were not wholly wrong.

            Some of the hieroglyphs, for example,
            the symbol "ankh"...

            ...which means life, are ideograms
            or pictograms.

            But the key to the enterprise...

            ...Champollion's success, rested
            on his realization...

            ...that the hieroglyphs were
            essentially letters and syllables.

            In retrospect, it sounds almost easy.

            But it took people hundreds of years
            before they figured it out.

            Champollion walked these halls and
            casually read the inscriptions...

            ...which had mystified everybody else.

            Answering the question he had
            posed as a child to Fourier:

            "What do they mean? "

            What a joy it must have
            been for him...

            ...to open this one-way communications
            channel with another civilization...

            ...to permit a culture which
            had been mute for millennia...

            ...to speak of its history,
            magic, medicine...

            ...religion, politics, philosophy.

            Today, we also are seeking messages...

            ...from an ancient and
            exotic civilization.

            A civilization hidden from us...

            ...not in time, but in space.

            Today, we are searching for
            a message from the stars.

            We have not found it so far.
            We have, as yet, no Champollion.

            But we are just beginning.

            Perhaps those who will decipher the
            first interstellar communications...

            ...are alive at this moment,
            somewhere on the planet Earth.

            Extraterrestrial beings will
            have a different biology...

            ...a different culture,
            a different language.

            How could we possibly understand
            their messages?

            Is there in any sense
            a cosmic Rosetta Stone?

            I believe there is.

            All the technical civilizations in
            the cosmos, no matter how different...

            ...must have one language in common:

            The language called "science."

            The laws of nature are
            everywhere the same.

            Every chemical element has
            a specific signature in the spectrum.

            So there are identical patterns in the
            light of a candle flame on Earth...

            ...and in the light of
            a distant galaxy.

            The spectra show not only...

            ...that the same chemical elements
            exist throughout space...

            ...but also that the same
            laws of quantum mechanics...

            ...govern atoms everywhere.

            Beings growing up on any world...

            ...must come to grips with
            the identical laws of nature.

            Galaxies billions of light-years
            distant evolve a spiral form.

            So does our own Milky Way.

            The same gravitational forces
            are at work.

            And on planets also:

            There are spiral storm
            systems on Jupiter.

            The same patterns are common on Earth.

            The intelligent beings on every
            world will, sooner or later...

            ...understand the laws of nature.

            Someday, perhaps soon...

            ...a message from the depths of space
            may arrive on our small world.

            If we wish to understand it...

            ...we first have to understand
            science.

            We do not expect an advanced
            technical civilization...

            ...on any other planet
            of our solar system.

            If they were only a little behind us,
            10,000 years, say...

            ...they would have no advanced
            technology at all.

            If they're a little ahead of us...

            ...we who are already exploring
            the solar system...

            ...then they should be here by now.

            To communicate with other
            civilizations...

            ...our technology must reach across
            not merely...

            ...interplanetary distances...

            ...but interstellar distances.

            Ideally, the method
            should be inexpensive.

            A huge amount of information could
            be sent and received at little cost.

            It should be fast...

            ...so an interstellar dialogue
            is eventually possible.

            It ought to be obvious...

            ...so that any technical civilization,
            no matter its evolutionary path...

            ...will discover it early.

            Surprisingly, there is such a method.

            It's called radio astronomy.

            This is the largest
            radio/radar telescope...

            ...on the planet Earth,
            the Arecibo Observatory.

            It's located in a remote valley
            on the island of Puerto Rico.

            It sends and receives radio signals.

            But it's so large and powerful...

            ...it can communicate with
            an identical radio telescope...

            ...15,000 light-years away...

            ...halfway to the center
            of the Milky Way galaxy.

            The Arecibo Observatory has been
            used, although sparingly...

            ...to search for signals
            from civilizations in space...

            ...and, just once...

            ...to broadcast a message
            to a distant star cluster...

            ...called "M13."

            But is there anyone out there
            to talk to?

            With 400 billion stars in
            the Milky Way galaxy alone...

            ...could ours be the only one
            with an inhabited planet?

            How much more likely it is...

            ...that the galaxy is throbbing and
            humming with advanced societies.

            Perhaps near one of those
            pinpoints of light in our night sky...

            ...someone quite different from us...

            ...is glancing idly at
            the star we call the sun...

            ...and entertaining,
            just for a moment...

            ...an outrageous speculation.

            There are an enormous number
            of stars.

            Only some of them will have
            planets suitable for life.

            On only some of those worlds
            will intelligence arise.

            And perhaps a few of those
            civilizations will avoid...

            ...the trap jointly set by their
            technology and their passions.

            If there are many civilizations,
            one of them should be rather close by.

            If there are few civilizations...

            ...then even the nearest
            may be very far away.

            This is one of the great questions:
            How many advanced civilizations...

            ...capable at least of radio astronomy
            are there in the Milky Way galaxy?

            Let's call the number of such
            civilizations by capital letter "N."

            It's a number.
            It depends on many things.

            It depends on the number
            of stars in the Milky Way.

            Let's call that N sub-star.

            The fraction of stars
            that have planets...

            ...is called f sub-p.

            The average number of planets
            in a given solar system...

            ...ecologically suitable for life...

            ...is called n sub-e.

            The fraction of suitable planets
            in which life actually arises...

            ...is called f sub-I.

            The fraction of inhabited planets...

            ...on which intelligence emerges...

            ...is called f sub-i.

            On the fraction of those planets in
            which the intelligent beings evolve...

            ...a technical, communicative
            civilization...

            ...call that f sub-c.

            Finally, it depends on the fraction
            of a planet's lifetime...

            ...that's graced by
            a technical civilization.

            Call that f sub-L.

            If we multiply all these
            numbers together...

            ...we've estimated N,
            the number of civilizations.

            This equation, due mainly to
            Frank Drake of Cornell...

            ...is only a sentence.

            The verb is "equals."

            So let's try to go through
            the program of this equation.

            By carefully counting
            the number of stars...

            ...in small but representative regions
            of the sky...

            ...we find that the total number
            of stars in the Milky Way...

            ...is about 400 billion.

            That's a lot of stars.

            What about planets?

            Well, in studies of double stars...

            ...and investigations of
            the motions of nearby stars...

            ...and in many theoretical studies...

            ...we get a strong hint that many...

            ...perhaps even most stars...

            ...are accompanied by planets.

            So let's take f sub-p...

            ...the fraction of stars that
            have planets as a quarter.

            Then, the total number of
            planetary systems in the galaxy...

            ...is 400 billion times a quarter...

            ...or 100 billion.

            We'll write down our running totals
            in red.

            Now if each system were
            to have, say...

            ...ten planets as ours does, there
            would be 100 billion times ten...

            ...or a trillion worlds in the galaxy.

            A vast arena for the cosmic drama.

            In our own solar system...

            ...there are several bodies that
            might be suitable for life...

            ...life of some sort.

            There's the Earth, of course...

            ...but there are possibilities for
            Mars, for Titan, perhaps for Jupiter.

            If other systems are similar, there
            may be many suitable worlds per system.

            But to be conservative,
            let's choose...

            ...n sub-e equal two.

            Two worlds suitable for life
            per system.

            The planets that are
            suitable for life...

            ...would be 100 billion times
            two, or 200 billion.

            Now what about life?

            Under very general
            cosmic conditions...

            ...the molecules of life are readily
            made and spontaneously self-assemble.

            It's conceivable there might be
            some impediment, like some...

            ...difficulty in the origin of
            the genetic code, say.

            Although that's very unlikely, given
            billions of years for evolution.

            On the Earth, life arose very fast
            after the planet was formed.

            So let's choose f sub-I...

            ...the fraction of suitable worlds in
            which life does arise, as a half.

            The number of planets in the Milky Way
            in which life has arisen once...

            ...is 100 billion times
            two, times a half.

            Or again, 100 billion.

            100 billion inhabited worlds.

            Now the estimates get tougher.

            Many individually unlikely events
            had to occur for...

            ...our species and our technology
            to emerge.

            On the other hand, there might
            be many different roads...

            ...to high technology.

            Some scientists think that...

            ...the path from trilobites to radio
            telescopes, or the equivalent...

            ...goes like a shot
            in all planetary systems.

            Other scientists disagree.

            Let's take some middle ground
            and choose f sub-i...

            ...as a tenth...

            ...and f sub-c as also a tenth.

            Meaning that only one percent,
            a tenth times a tenth...

            ...of inhabited planets eventually
            produce a technical civilization.

            If we were to multiply
            all these factors together...

            ...we would find 100 billion
            times a tenth times a tenth.

            Or one billion planets...

            ...on which civilizations
            have arisen at least once.

            Now what percentage of
            the lifetime of a planet...

            ...is marked by a technical
            civilization?

            Earth has harbored a civilization
            capable of radio astronomy...

            ...only for a few decades,
            the last few...

            ...out of a lifetime of
            a few billion years.

            It's hardly out of the question
            that we might...

            ...destroy ourselves tomorrow.

            If that's a typical case,
            then f sub-L...

            ...would be a few decades divided
            by a few billion years...

            ...or one hundred millionth...

            ...a very small number.

            And then, N would be a billion
            times a hundred millionth.

            Or N may be just...

            ...ten civilizations.

            A tiny smattering, a pitiful few...

            ...technological civilizations
            in the galaxy.

            But civilizations then...

            ...might take billions of years
            of tortuous evolution to arise...

            ...and then snuff themselves out
            in an instant of...

            ...unforgivable neglect.

            If this is a typical case...

            ...there may be few others...

            ...maybe nobody else at all
            for us to talk to.

            But consider the alternative:

            That occasionally civilizations
            learn to live with high technology...

            ...and survive for geological or
            stellar evolutionary time scales.

            If only one percent
            of civilizations can...

            ...survive technological
            adolescence...

            ...then f sub-L would be
            not 100 millionth...

            ...but only a hundredth.

            And then the number of civilizations
            would be a billion times a hundredth.

            The civilizations in the galaxy
            would be measured...

            ...in the millions.

            Millions of technical civilizations.

            So if civilizations do not
            always destroy themselves...

            ...shortly after discovering
            radio astronomy...

            ...then the sky may be
            softly humming...

            ...with messages from the stars...

            ...with signals from civilizations
            enormously older...

            ...and wiser than we.

            If there are millions of civilizations
            in the Milky Way...

            ...each capable of radio astronomy...

            ...how far away is the nearest one?

            If they're distributed randomly
            through space...

            ...then the nearest one will be
            some 200 light-years away.

            But within 200 light-years...

            ...there are hundreds
            of thousands of stars.

            To find the needle in this haystack...

            ...requires a dedicated
            and systematic search.

            Many cosmic radio sources have nothing
            to do with intelligent life.

            So how would we know that
            we were receiving a message?

            The transmitting civilization can make
            it very easy for us, if they wished.

            Imagine we're in the course
            of a systematic search.

            Or in the midst of some more
            conventional observations.

            And suppose one day...

            ...we find a strong signal
            slowly emerging.

            Not just some background hiss...

            ...but a methodical series of pulses.

            (SIGNAL PINGS)

            The numbers one, two, three, five...

            ...seven, eleven, thirteen.

            A signal made of prime numbers.

            Numbers divisible only
            by one and themselves.

            There is no natural astrophysical
            process that generates prime numbers.

            We would have to conclude...

            ...that someone fond of
            elementary mathematics...

            ...was saying hello.

            (SIGNAL PINGS)

            This would be no more than a beacon
            to attract our attention.

            The main message will be subtler...

            ...more hidden, far richer.

            We may have to work hard to find it.

            But the beacon signal alone
            would be profoundly significant.

            It would mean someone has learned to
            survive technological adolescence...

            ...that self-destruction
            is not inevitable...

            ...that we also may have a future.

            Such knowledge, it seems to me...

            ...might be worth a great price.

            Very likely...

            ...some new Champollion
            would go on...

            ...to decode the main message,
            using our interstellar Rosetta Stone:

            The common language of science
            and mathematics.

            Think of the glories of
            an exotic civilization...

            ...far more advanced than we...

            ...collected by the great
            radio telescopes of Earth.

            Perhaps they'd send a compilation of
            the knowledge of a million worlds:

            The Encyclopedia Galactica.

            Receiving an interstellar message...

            ...would be a major event
            in human history...

            ...and the beginning of the
            deprovincialization of our planet.

            A serious and systematic
            radio search...

            ...for extraterrestrial
            civilizations may come soon.

            Preliminary steps are being taken
            both in the United States...

            ...and in the Soviet Union.

            It's comparatively inexpensive.

            A search taking decades would cost
            less than the budget overruns...

            ...on a single modest weapons system
            in a single year.

            Our technology is now
            fully adequate...

            ...for this great challenge.

            But no systematic search program...

            ...has ever been approved
            by any nation on Earth.

            When will we decide to search for...

            ...what other civilizations there
            may be in the vast cosmic ocean?

            But whether there are only a few
            advanced galactic civilizations...

            ...or millions...

            ...shouldn't some of them
            have voyaged to Earth?

            On one hand, if even a small fraction
            of technical civilizations...

            ...learned to live with their
            potential for self-destruction...

            ...there should be enormous
            numbers of them in the galaxy.

            On the other hand, despite claims
            about UFOs and ancient astronauts...

            ...there's no creditable evidence that
            Earth has been visited, now or ever.

            But isn't this a contradiction?

            If the nearest civilization is,
            say, 200 light-years away...

            ...it'd take them only 200 years
            to get from there to here...

            ...at light speed.

            Even if they were traveling
            1000 times slower than that...

            ...aliens could've come here during...

            ...the tenure of human beings
            on Earth.

            So why aren't they here?

            There's many possible answers.
            One is that...

            ...maybe we're the first.

            Some technical civilization
            has to be first...

            ...to emerge in the history
            of the galaxy.

            Or maybe all technical civilizations
            promptly destroy themselves.

            That seems to me very unlikely.

            Maybe there's some problem
            with space flight...

            ...that we've been too dumb
            to figure out.

            Or maybe they are here,
            but in hiding...

            ...because of an ethic of
            non-interference...

            ...with emerging civilizations.

            We might imagine them,
            curious and dispassionate...

            ...watching us to determine
            whether this year again...

            ...we manage to avoid
            self-destruction.

            But there's another explanation which
            is consistent with what we know.

            And that's that it's a big cosmos.

            If years ago, an advanced interstellar
            spacefaring civilization emerged...

            ...200 light-years away,
            why would they come here?

            They'd have no reason to think
            the Earth was special.

            There are no signs of technology,
            not even our radio transmissions...

            ...which have had time
            to go 200 light-years.

            From their point of view,
            all nearby planetary systems...

            ...might seem equally attractive
            for exploration.

            How would an interstellar
            civilization set out to explore...

            ...its neighboring star systems?

            It might establish staging posts...

            ...colonies,
            on planets of nearby stars.

            But this would take time.

            Time to find and modify
            favorable planets.

            Time to build new spacecraft.

            Eventually, later generations
            of explorers would set out...

            ...wending their way
            among the worlds...

            ...creating an interstellar
            nervous system...

            ...binding up the stars.

            Perhaps they'd come upon another
            expanding civilization...

            ...and encounter beings
            previously known...

            ...only from their radio
            transmissions.

            Star wars are unlikely.

            One civilization certainly would be
            far more advanced than the other.

            It would be no contest.

            Perhaps they would cooperate...

            ...exploring together a small province
            of the Milky Way.

            But even nearby civilizations
            could spend millions of years...

            ...roving between the stars...

            ...without ever stumbling upon
            our obscure solar system.

            In a galaxy of 400 billion suns...

            ...perhaps no one has found us
            just yet.

            Advanced interstellar civilizations
            would know about many worlds.

            Some inhabited, some barren.

            Perhaps they would share
            their findings...

            ...assembling some vast repository...

            ...of the knowledge of
            countless worlds.

            They might compile an
            Encyclopedia Galactica.

            Suppose we could browse through
            that encyclopedia.

            We would choose some nearby
            province of the galaxy...

            ...a region that's fairly
            well-explored.

            And then slowly leaf through
            the worlds.

            The young Champollion was inspired...

            ...by reading Fourier's
            description of Egypt.

            Imagine the impact on us...

            ...if we could study
            a rich compilation...

            ...of not merely one world...

            ...but billions.

            Just possibly, not too far
            from our solar system...

            ...we might find
            a technical civilization...

            ...only a little more
            advanced than we.

            Let's look them up in
            the Galactic Encyclopedia.

            What would a civilization
            far more advanced than ours...

            ...be up to?

            There may be engineering on a scale...

            ...that dwafts our proudest
            achievements.

            There may be cultures that disassemble
            other planets in their system...

            ...and reassemble them around
            their world to make a ring...

            ...or a shell with
            their planet inside.

            Imagine the energy crisis of a really
            advanced planetary civilization.

            They've used up all their fuels.

            They depend on solar power.

            But their growth is still severely
            limited by the energy available.

            An enormous amount of energy
            is generated by the local star.

            But most of the star's light
            doesn't fall on their planet.

            So perhaps they would build a shell...

            ...to surround their star...

            ...and harvest every photon
            of sunlight.

            Such beings, such civilizations...

            ...would bear little resemblance
            to anything we know.

            Perhaps someday there will be an entry
            in the Encyclopedia Galactica...

            ...for our planet.

            Or perhaps even now
            there exists somewhere...

            ...a planetary dossier, garnered
            from our television broadcasts...

            ...or from some discreet
            survey mission.

            They may summon up the index of blue
            worlds in our part of the Milky Way...

            ...until they came to
            the listing for Earth.

            What would they know about us?

            What would they think of us?

            We have always watched
            the stars and mused...

            ...about whether there are other
            beings who think and wonder.

            In a cosmic setting vast and old...

            ...beyond ordinary human
            understanding, we are a little lonely.

            In the deepest sense, the search
            for extraterrestrial intelligence...

            ...is a search for who we are.

            Since Cosmos was released...

            ...interest in UFOs has persisted.

            It seems to me that there
            are fewer sightings of...

            ...strange objects in the skies
            these days...

            ...and more stories of encounters
            with alleged extraterrestrials...

            ...like the account of Betty and Barney
            Hill that we dramatized.

            There are still people who claim
            to have been abducted by aliens...

            ...or even sexually abused,
            or even impregnated by them.

            Best-selling purportedly serious books
            have been written about such claims.

            But the critical fact remains
            that all we have still is...

            ...just anecdote.

            There are no close-up photos,
            no artifacts...

            ...nothing that'd convince a skeptic.

            All there are is stories.

            And stories just aren't good enough
            on a matter of this importance.

            I'm still waiting for hard evidence.

            The radio search for extraterrestrial
            intelligence has been picking up.

            In Harvard, Massachusetts, a radio
            telescope monitoring 8 million...

            ...separate radio channels...

            ...has been scanning the skies
            for signals.

            This program, called META,
            is supported entirely by...

            ...the Pasadena, California-based
            Planetary Society.

            Paid for by members' contributions.

            A similar planetary society search...

            ...to examine the southern skies
            and the center of the Milky Way...

            ...is to be performed in Argentina.

            These searches are by far...

            ...the most sophisticated
            ever attempted.

            A much more sensitive program...

            ...covering almost the entire
            accessible radio spectrum...

            ...is to be mustered by NASA.

            The search for extraterrestrial
            intelligence is central...

            ...to our understanding of the universe
            and our view of ourselves.

            It's well worth doing.

            But the simple fact is that...

            ...while we may consider
            extraterrestrial intelligence likely...

            ...there is as yet
            no evidence at all...

            ...that it exists.

            The search continues.

            NARRATOR: "I call Heaven and Earth
            to witness against you this day...

            ...that I have set before thee
            life and death...

            ...the blessing and the curse.

            Therefore choose life,
            that thou mayest live...

            ...thou and thy seed."

            SAGAN: Nearly 200 years ago,
            in the Gulf of Alaska...

            ...at a place called Lituya Bay...

            ...two cultures that had never
            met experienced a first encounter.

            The Tlingit people...

            ...lived more or less as their
            ancestors had for thousands of years.

            They were nomads...



            ...moving often by canoe
            between numerous campsites...

            ...where they caught plentiful
            fish and sea otters...

            ...and traded with neighboring tribes.

            (SPEAKS IN TLINGIT)

            The creator they worshiped
            was the raven god...

            ...whom they pictured as an enormous
            black bird with white wings.

            And one July day in 1786...

            ...the raven god appeared.

            The Tlingit were terrified.

            They knew that anyone looking directly
            at the god would be turned to stone.

            From the other side of the planet
            had come an expedition...

            ...led by the French
            explorer La P?rouse.

            It was the most elaborately planned
            scientific voyage of the century...

            ...sent around the world to gather
            knowledge about the geography...



            ...natural history and peoples
            of distant lands.

            But to the Tlingit...

            ...whose world was confined to the
            islands and inlets of south Alaska...

            ...this great vessel could have
            come only from the gods.

            There was one among them who
            dared to look more deeply.

            He was an old warrior,
            and nearly blind.

            He said that his life
            was almost over.

            For the common good, he would
            approach the raven...

            ...to learn whether the god really
            would turn his people to stone.

            He set out on his own
            voyage of discovery...

            ...to confront the end of the world.

            The old man made himself
            look hard at the raven...

            ...and saw that it was not a
            great bird from the sky...

            ...but the work of men like himself.

            This first encounter turned
            out to be peaceful.

            Men of the La P?rouse expedition
            were under orders...

            ...to treat with respect
            any people they might discover.

            An exceptional policy
            for its time, and after.

            La P?rouse and the Tlingit
            exchanged goods...

            ...and then the strange ship
            sailed away, never to return.

            Not all encounters between nations
            had been so peaceful.

            Before 1519...

            ...the Aztecs of Mexico had
            never seen a gun.

            They too believed at first
            that their strange visitors...

            ...had come from the sky.

            The Spaniards under Cortez...

            ...were not constrained by
            any injunctions against violence.

            Their true nature and intentions
            soon became clear.

            Unlike the La P?rouse expedition...

            ...the Conquistadors sought,
            not knowledge, but gold.

            They used their superior weapons
            to loot and murder.

            In their madness, they
            obliterated a civilization.

            In the name of piety...

            ...in a mockery of their religion...

            ...the Spaniards utterly
            destroyed a society...

            ...with an art, astronomy,
            and architecture...

            ...the equal of anything in Europe.

            We revile the Conquistadors for their
            cruelty and shortsightedness...

            ...for choosing death.

            We admire La P?rouse and the Tlingit
            for their courage and wisdom...

            ...for choosing life.

            The choice is with us still.

            But the civilization now in
            jeopardy is all humanity.

            As the ancient mythmakers knew...

            ...we're children equally
            of the Earth and sky.

            In our tenure on this planet...

            ...we've accumulated dangerous
            evolutionary baggage:

            Propensities for
            aggression and ritual...

            ...submission to leaders,
            hostility to outsiders.

            All of which puts our
            survival in some doubt.

            But we've also acquired
            compassion for others...

            ...love for our children...

            ...a desire to learn from
            history and experience...

            ...and a great, soaring,
            passionate intelligence.

            The clear tools for our continued
            survival and prosperity.

            Which aspects of our nature
            will prevail...

            ...is uncertain.

            Particularly when our visions and
            prospects are bound...

            ...to one small part of
            the small planet Earth.

            But up there in the cosmos...

            ...an inescapable perspective awaits.

            National boundaries are not evident
            when we view the Earth from space.

            Fanatic ethnic or religious
            or national identifications...

            ...are difficult to support...

            ...when we see our planet
            as a fragile blue crescent...

            ...fading to become an inconspicuous
            point of light...

            ...against the bastion and citadel
            of the stars.

            There are not yet obvious signs of
            extraterrestrial intelligence...

            ...and this makes us wonder whether
            civilizations like ours...

            ...rush inevitably, headlong
            to self-destruction.

            I dream about it.

            And sometimes they're bad dreams.

            In the vision of a dream...

            ...I once imagined myself...

            ...searching for other civilizations
            in the cosmos.

            Among a hundred billion galaxies...

            ...and a billion trillion stars...

            ...life and intelligence should
            have arisen on many worlds.

            Some worlds are barren
            and desolate...

            ...on them life never began...

            ...or may have been extinguished
            in some cosmic catastrophe.

            There may be worlds rich in life...

            ...but not yet evolved to
            intelligence and high technology.

            There may be civilizations
            that achieve technology...

            ...and then promptly use it
            to destroy themselves.

            And perhaps
            there are also beings...

            ...who learned to live with their
            technology and themselves.

            Beings who endure...

            ...and become citizens of the cosmos.

            Immersed in these thoughts...

            ...I found myself approaching
            a world that was clearly inhabited...

            ...a world I had visited before.

            I saw a planet encompassed by light...

            ...and recognized the signature
            of intelligence.

            But suddenly...

            ...darkness, total and absolute.

            In my dream...

            ...I could read the Book of Worlds.

            A vast encyclopedia...

            ...of a billion planets
            within the Milky Way.

            What could the computer tell me...

            ...about this now-darkened world?

            They must have survived
            some earlier catastrophe.

            Locally initiated contact:

            Maybe their television broadcasts.

            Their biology was different
            from ours.

            High technology.

            I wondered what those
            lights had been for.

            There must have been
            signs of trouble.

            Probability of survival
            in a century...

            ...less than 1%. Not very good odds.

            "Communications interrupted."

            Their world society had failed.

            They had made the ultimate mistake.

            I felt a longing
            to return to Earth.

            The television transmissions
            of Earth rushed past me...

            ...expanding away from our planet
            at the speed of light.

            Then, suddenly...

            ...silence...

            ...total and absolute.

            But the dream was not yet done.

            Had we destroyed our home?

            What had we done to the Earth?

            There had been many ways
            for life to perish at our hands.

            We had poisoned the air and water.

            We had ravaged the land.

            Perhaps we had changed the climate.

            Could it have been a plague...

            ...or nuclear war?

            I remembered the galactic computer.

            What would it say about the Earth?

            There was our region of the galaxy.

            There was our world.

            I had found the entry for Earth.

            Humanity, third from the sun.

            They had heard our
            television broadcasts...

            ...and thought them an application
            for cosmic citizenship.

            Our technology had been
            growing enormously.

            They got that right.

            200 nation states.

            About six global powers.

            The potential to become one planet.

            Probability of survival over
            a century, here also...

            ...less than l% .

            So it was nuclear war.

            A full nuclear exchange.

            There would be no more
            big questions.

            No more answers.

            Never again a love or a child.

            No descendants to remember us
            and be proud.

            No more voyages to the stars.

            No more songs from the Earth.

            I saw East Africa...

            ...and thought a few
            million years ago...

            ...we humans took our
            first steps there.

            Our brains grew and changed.

            The old parts began to be
            guided by the new parts.

            And this made us human...

            ...with compassion and foresight
            and reason.

            But instead, we listened to that
            reptilian voice within us...

            ...counseling fear, territoriality...

            ...aggression.

            We accepted the products of science.

            We rejected its methods.

            Maybe the reptiles will evolve
            intelligence once more.

            Perhaps, one day, there will be
            civilizations again on Earth.

            There will be life.

            There will be intelligence.

            But there will be no more humans.

            Not here, not on a billion worlds.

            Every thinking person
            fears nuclear war...

            ...and every technological nation
            plans for it.

            Everyone knows it's madness...

            ...and every country has an excuse.

            There's a dreary chain of causality.

            The Germans were
            working on the bomb...

            ...at the beginning of World War II.

            So the Americans
            had to make one first.

            If the Americans had one,
            the Russians had to have one.

            Then, the British, the French...

            ...the Chinese, the Indians,
            the Pakistanis.

            Many nations now collect
            nuclear weapons.

            They're easy to make.

            You can steal fissionable material
            from nuclear reactors.

            Nuclear weapons have almost become
            a home handicraft industry.

            The conventional bombs of World War II
            were called "blockbusters."

            Filled with 20 tons of TNT, they
            could destroy a city block.

            All the bombs dropped on all the
            cities of World War II...

            ...amounted to some
            2 million tons of TNT.

            Two megatons.

            Coventry and Rotterdam.

            Dresden and Tokyo.

            All the death that rained
            from the skies...

            ...between 1939 and 1945.

            100,000 blockbusters.
            Two megatons.

            Today, two megatons is the equivalent
            of a single thermonuclear bomb.

            One bomb with the destructive force...

            ...of the Second World War.

            But there are tens of thousands
            of nuclear weapons.

            The missile and bomber forces
            of the Soviet Union and U. S...

            ...have warheads aimed at over
            15,000 designated targets.

            No place on the planet is safe.

            The energy contained
            in these weapons...

            ...genies of death...

            ...patiently awaiting
            the rubbing of the lamps...

            ...totals far more than
            10,000 megatons.

            But with the destruction
            concentrated efficiently...

            ...not over six years,
            but over a few hours.

            A blockbuster for every family
            on the planet.

            A World War II every second...

            ...for the length of a lazy afternoon.

            (BIRDS CHIRPING)

            The bomb dropped on Hiroshima...

            ...killed 70,000 people.

            In a full nuclear exchange...

            ...in the paroxysm of global death...

            ...the equivalent of
            a million Hiroshima bombs...

            ...would be dropped all
            over the world.

            In such an exchange
            not everyone would be...

            ...killed by the blast and firestorm
            and the immediate radiation.

            There would be other agonies:

            Loss of loved ones...

            ...the legions of the burned and
            blinded and mutilated...

            ...the absence of medical care...

            ...disease, plague...

            ...long-lived radiation poisoning
            of the soil and the water.

            The threat of tumors and stillbirths
            and malformed children.

            And the hopeless sense of
            a civilization destroyed for nothing.

            The knowledge that we could have
            prevented it and did not.

            The global balance of terror...

            ...pioneered by the U.S.
            and the Soviet Union...

            ...holds hostage
            all the citizens of the Earth.

            Each side persistently probes...

            ...the limits of
            the other's tolerance...

            ...like the Cuban missile crisis...

            ...the testing of
            anti-satellite weapons...

            ...the Vietnam and Afghanistan wars.

            The hostile military
            establishments are...

            ...locked in some ghastly
            mutual embrace.

            Each needs the other.

            But the balance of terror
            is a delicate balance...

            ...with very little margin
            for miscalculation.

            And the world impoverishes
            itself by spending...

            ...a trillion dollars a year
            on preparations for war.

            And by employing perhaps...

            ...half the scientists and high
            technologists on the planet...

            ...in military endeavors.

            How would we explain all this...

            ...to a dispassionate
            extraterrestrial observer?

            What account would we give
            of our stewardship...

            ...of the planet Earth?

            We have heard the rationales
            offered by the superpowers.

            We know who speaks
            for the nations.

            But who speaks
            for the human species?

            Who speaks for Earth?

            From an extraterrestrial perspective,
            our global civilization is...

            ...clearly on the edge of failure...

            ...in the most important task it faces:

            Preserving the lives and well-being
            of its citizens...

            ...and the future habitability
            of the planet.

            But if we're willing to live with the
            growing likelihood of nuclear war...

            ...shouldn't we also be willing
            to explore vigorously...

            ...every possible means to
            prevent nuclear war?

            Shouldn't we consider,
            in every nation...

            ...major changes in the traditional
            ways of doing things?

            A fundamental restructuring...

            ...of economic, political,
            social and religious institutions?

            We've reached a point where
            there can be no more...

            ...special interests or cases.

            Nuclear arms threaten every
            person on Earth.

            Fundamental changes in society
            are sometimes labeled...

            ...impractical or contrary
            to human nature...

            ...as if nuclear war were practical...

            ...or as if there were only
            one human nature.

            But fundamental changes can
            clearly be made.

            We're surrounded by them.

            In the last two centuries,
            abject slavery...

            ...which was with us for
            thousands of years...

            ...has almost entirely
            been eliminated...

            ...in a stirring
            worldwide revolution.

            Women, systematically mistreated
            for millennia...

            ...are gradually gaining the political
            and economic power...

            ...traditionally denied to them.

            And some wars of aggression have
            recently been stopped or curtailed...

            ...because of a revulsion...

            ...felt by the people in
            the aggressor nations.

            The old appeals...

            ...to racial, sexual,
            and religious chauvinism...

            ...and to rabid nationalist fervor...

            ...are beginning not to work.

            A new consciousness is developing
            which sees the Earth as...

            ...a single organism...

            ...and recognizes that an organism
            at war with itself...

            ...is doomed.

            We are one planet.

            One of the great revelations of
            the age of space exploration...

            ...is the image of the Earth,
            finite and lonely...

            ...somehow vulnerable, bearing
            the entire human species...

            ...through the oceans
            of space and time.

            But this is an ancient perception.

            In the 3rd century B. C...

            ...our planet was mapped and
            accurately measured...

            ...by a Greek scientist named
            Eratosthenes, who worked in Egypt.

            This was the world as he knew it.

            Eratosthenes was the director...

            ...of the great Library
            of Alexandria...

            ...the center of science and learning
            in the ancient world.

            Aristotle had argued that humanity
            was divided into Greeks...

            ...and everybody else,
            who he called "barbarians"...

            ...and that the Greeks should keep
            themselves racially pure.

            He taught that it was fitting for
            the Greeks to enslave other peoples.

            But Eratosthenes criticized Aristotle
            for his blind chauvinism.

            He believed there was good and bad
            in every nation.

            The Greek conquerors had invented
            a new god for the Egyptians...

            ...but he looked remarkably Greek.

            Alexander was portrayed as pharaoh...

            ...in a gesture to the Egyptians.

            But in practice, the Greeks were
            confident of their superiority.

            The protests of the librarian hardly
            constituted a serious challenge...

            ...to prevailing prejudices.

            Their world was as imperfect
            as our own.

            But the Ptolemies, the Greek kings of
            Egypt who followed Alexander...

            ...had at least this virtue:

            They supported the advancement
            of knowledge.

            Popular ideas about the nature of
            the cosmos were challenged...

            ...and some of them, discarded.

            New ideas were proposed...

            ...and found to be in
            better accord with the facts.

            There were imaginative proposals,
            vigorous debates...

            ...brilliant syntheses.

            The resulting treasure
            of knowledge...

            ...was recorded and preserved
            for centuries...

            ...on these shelves.

            Science came of age
            in this library.

            The Ptolemies didn't merely
            collect old knowledge.

            They supported scientific research
            and generated new knowledge.

            The results were amazing.

            Eratosthenes accurately calculated
            the size of the Earth.

            He mapped it...

            ...and he argued that it could be
            circumnavigated.

            Hipparchus anticipated that
            stars come into being...

            ...slowly move during the course
            of centuries...

            ...and eventually perish.

            It was he who first catalogued...

            ...the positions and magnitudes
            of the stars...

            ...in order to determine whether
            there were such changes.

            Euclid produced a textbook
            on geometry...

            ...which human beings learned from
            for 23 centuries.

            It's still a great read, full
            of the most elegant proofs.

            Galen wrote basic works on
            healing and anatomy...

            ...which dominated medicine
            until the Renaissance.

            These are just a few examples.

            There were dozens of
            great scholars here...

            ...and hundreds of fundamental
            discoveries.

            Some of those discoveries have
            a distinctly modern ring.

            Apollonius of Perga studied
            the parabola and the ellipse...

            ...curves that we know today describe
            the paths of falling objects...

            ...in a gravitational field...

            ...and space vehicles traveling
            between the planets.

            Heron of Alexandria invented
            steam engines and gear trains...

            ...he was the author of
            the first book on robots.

            Imagine how different our world
            would be if those discoveries...

            ...had been used
            for the benefit of everyone.

            If the humane perspective
            of Eratosthenes...

            ...had been widely
            adopted and applied.

            But this was not to be.

            Alexandria was the greatest city...

            ...the Western world had ever seen.

            People from all nations came here...

            ...to live, to trade, to learn.

            On a given day...

            ...these harbors were thronged...

            ...with merchants and scholars,
            tourists.

            It's probably here...

            ...that the word "cosmopolitan"
            realized its true meaning...

            ...of a citizen,
            not just of a nation...

            ...but of the cosmos.

            To be a citizen of the cosmos.

            Here were clearly the seeds
            of our modern world.

            But why didn't they
            take root and flourish?

            Why, instead, did the West slumber
            through 1000 years of darkness...

            ...until Columbus and Copernicus
            and their contemporaries...

            ...rediscovered the work done here?

            I cannot give you a simple answer...

            ...but I do know this:

            There is no record in the entire
            history of the library...

            ...that any of the illustrious scholars
            and scientists who worked here...

            ...ever seriously challenged...

            ...a single political or economic
            or religious assumption...

            ...of the society in which they lived.

            The permanence of the stars
            was questioned.

            The justice of slavery was not.

            Science and learning in general...

            ...were the preserve
            of the privileged few.

            The vast population of this city
            had not the vaguest notion...

            ...of the great discoveries being
            made within these walls.

            How could they?

            The new findings were not
            explained or popularized.

            The progress made here
            benefited them little.

            Science was not part of their lives.

            The discoveries in mechanics, say...

            ...or steam technology...

            ...mainly were applied to
            the perfection of weapons...

            ...to the encouragement
            of superstition...

            ...to the amusement of kings.

            Scientists never seemed to grasp
            the enormous potential...

            ...of machines to free people...

            ...from arduous and repetitive labor.

            The intellectual achievements
            of antiquity...

            ...had few practical applications.

            Science never captured
            the imagination of the multitude.

            There was no counterbalance
            to stagnation, to pessimism...

            ...to the most abject surrender
            to mysticism.

            So when, at long last...

            ...the mob came
            to burn the place down...

            ...there was nobody to stop them.

            Let me tell you about the end.

            It's a story about the last
            scientist to work in this place.

            A mathematician, astronomer,
            physicist...

            ...and head of the school of Neo-
            Platonic philosophy in Alexandria.

            That's an extraordinary range
            of accomplishments...

            ...for any individual, in any age.

            Her name was Hypatia.

            She was born in this city
            in the year 370 A.D.

            This was a time when women
            had essentially no options.

            They were considered property.

            Nevertheless, Hypatia was able
            to move freely...

            ...unselfconsciously...

            ...through traditional male domains.

            By all accounts,
            she was a great beauty.

            And although she had many suitors...

            ...she had no interest in marriage.

            The Alexandria of Hypatia's time,
            by then long under Roman rule...

            ...was a city in grave conflict.

            Slavery, the cancer
            of the ancient world...

            ...had sapped classical civilization
            of its vitality.

            The growing Christian Church was...

            ...consolidating its power...

            ...and attempting to eradicate
            pagan influence and culture.

            Hypatia stood at the focus...

            ...at the epicenter
            of mighty social forces.

            Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria,
            despised her...

            ...in part because of her close
            friendship with a Roman governor...

            ...but also because she was a symbol
            of learning and science...

            ...which were largely identified
            by the early Church with paganism.

            In great personal danger...

            ...Hypatia continued to teach
            and to publish...

            ...until, in the year 415 A.D.,
            on her way to work...

            ...she was set upon...

            ...by a fanatical mob of
            Cyril's followers.

            They dragged her from her chariot...

            ...tore off her clothes...

            ...and flayed her flesh
            from her bones...

            ...with abalone shells.

            Her remains were burned,
            her works obliterated...

            ...her name forgotten.

            Cyril was made a saint.

            The glory you see around me...

            ...is nothing but a memory.

            It does not exist.

            The last remains of the
            library were destroyed...

            ...within a year of Hypatia's death.

            It's as if an entire
            civilization had undergone...

            ...a sort of self-inflicted
            radical brain surgery...

            ...so that most of its memories...

            ...discoveries, ideas and passions...

            ...were irrevocably wiped out.

            The loss was incalculable.

            In some cases, we know only...

            ...the tantalizing titles of books
            that had been destroyed.

            In most cases, we know neither
            the titles nor the authors.

            We do know that in this library...

            ...there were 123 different
            plays by Sophocles...

            ...of which only seven have
            survived to our time.

            One of those seven is Oedipus Rex.

            Similar numbers apply
            to the lost works of...

            ...Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes.

            It's a little as if the only
            surviving works of a man named...

            ...William Shakespeare...

            ...were Coriolanus
            and A Winter's Tale...

            ...although we knew he had
            written some other things...

            ...which were
            highly prized in his time.

            Plays called Hamlet, Macbeth...

            ...A Midsummer's Night Dream,
            Julius Caesar, King Lear...

            ...Romeo and Juliet.

            History is full of people...

            ...who, out of fear or ignorance...

            ...or the lust for power...

            ...have destroyed treasures
            of immeasurable value...

            ...which truly belong to all of us.

            We must not let it happen again.

            We have considered
            the destruction of worlds...

            ...and the end of civilizations.

            But there is another perspective
            by which to measure human endeavors.

            Let me tell you a story
            about the beginning.

            Some 15 billion years ago...

            ...our universe began...

            ...with the mightiest explosion
            of all time.

            The universe expanded,
            cooled and darkened.

            Energy condensed into matter,
            mostly hydrogen atoms.

            And these atoms accumulated
            into vast clouds...

            ...rushing away from each other...

            ...that would one day become
            the galaxies.

            Within these galaxies the first
            generation of stars was born...

            ...kindling the energy
            hidden in matter...

            ...flooding the cosmos with light.

            Hydrogen atoms had made
            suns and starlight.

            There were in those times
            no planets to receive the light...

            ...and no living creatures to admire
            the radiance of the heavens.

            But deep in the stellar furnaces...

            ...nuclear fusion was creating
            the heavier atoms:

            Carbon and oxygen,
            silicon and iron.

            These elements, the ash left
            by hydrogen...

            ...were the raw materials from which
            planets and life would later arise.

            At first, the heavy elements were
            trapped in the hearts of the stars.

            But massive stars soon
            exhausted their fuel...

            ...and in their death throes...

            ...returned most of their substance
            back into space.

            The interstellar gas became
            enriched in heavy elements.

            In the Milky Way galaxy...

            ...the matter of the cosmos was recycled
            into new generations of stars...

            ...now rich in heavy atoms.

            A legacy from
            their stellar ancestors.

            And in the cold
            of interstellar space...

            ...great turbulent clouds were
            gathered by gravity...

            ...and stirred by starlight.

            In their depths...

            ...the heavy atoms condensed into
            grains of rocky dust and ice...

            ...and complex
            carbon-based molecules.

            In accordance with the laws
            of physics and chemistry...

            ...hydrogen atoms had brought forth
            the stuff of life.

            In other clouds, more massive
            aggregates of gas and dust...

            ...formed later generations of stars.

            As new stars were formed...

            ...tiny condensations of matter
            accreted near them...

            ...inconspicuous motes of
            rock and metal, ice and gas...

            ...that would become the planets.

            And on these worlds,
            as in interstellar clouds...

            ...organic molecules formed...

            ...made of atoms that had been
            cooked inside the stars.

            In the tide pools and oceans
            of many worlds...

            ...molecules were destroyed by
            sunlight and assembled by chemistry.

            One day, among these
            natural experiments...

            ...a molecule arose, that,
            quite by accident...

            ...was able to make crude copies
            of itself.

            As time passed, self-replication
            became more accurate.

            Those molecules that copied better...

            ...produced more copies.

            Natural selection was underway.

            Elaborate molecular machines
            had evolved.

            Slowly, imperceptibly, life had begun.

            Collectives of organic molecules
            evolved into one-celled organisms.

            These produced multi-celled colonies.

            Their various parts became
            specialized organs.

            Some colonies attached themselves
            to the sea floor...

            ...others swam freely.

            Eyes evolved, and now the cosmos
            could see.

            Living things moved on
            to colonize the land.

            The reptiles held sway for a time...

            ...but gave way to small warm-blooded
            creatures with bigger brains...

            ...who developed dexterity and
            curiosity about their environment.

            They learned to use tools and
            fire and language.

            Star stuff,
            the ash of stellar alchemy...

            ...had emerged into consciousness.

            We are a way for the cosmos
            to know itself.

            We are creatures of the cosmos...

            ...and have always hungered
            to know our origins...

            ...to understand our connection
            with the universe.

            How did everything come to be?

            Every culture on the planet
            has devised its own response...

            ...to the riddle
            posed by the universe.

            Every culture celebrates
            the cycles of life and nature.

            There are many different ways
            of being human.

            But an extraterrestrial visitor...

            ...examining the differences
            among human societies...

            ...would find those
            differences trivial...

            ...compared to the similarities.

            We are one species.

            We are star stuff,
            harvesting starlight.

            Our lives, our past and our future...

            ...are tied to the sun, the moon
            and the stars.

            Our ancestors knew that
            their survival depended...

            ...on understanding the heavens.

            They built observatories
            and computers...

            ...to predict the changing of the
            seasons by the motions in the skies.

            We are, all of us...

            ...descended from astronomers.

            The discovery of order
            in the universe...

            ...of the laws of nature...

            ...is the foundation on which
            science builds today.

            Our conception of the cosmos...

            ...all of modern science
            and technology...

            ...trace back to questions
            raised by the stars.

            Yet, even 400 years ago...

            ...we still had no idea
            of our place in the universe.

            The long journey to
            that understanding...

            ...required both an unflinching
            respect for the facts...

            ...and a delight
            in the natural world.

            Johannes Kepler wrote:

            "We do not ask for what useful
            purpose the birds do sing...

            ...for song is their pleasure
            since they were created for singing.

            Similarly...

            ...we ought not to ask why the
            human mind troubles to fathom...

            ...the secrets of the heavens.

            The diversity of the phenomena
            of nature is so great...

            ...and the treasures hidden
            in the heavens so rich...

            ...precisely in order...

            ...that the human mind shall never
            be lacking in fresh nourishment."

            It is the birthright
            of every child...

            ...to encounter the cosmos anew...

            ...in every culture and every age.

            When this happens to us,
            we experience a deep sense of wonder.

            The most fortunate among
            us are guided by teachers...

            ...who channel this exhilaration.

            We are born
            to delight in the world.

            We are taught to distinguish
            our preconceptions from the truth.

            Then, new worlds are discovered...

            ...as we decipher the mysteries
            of the cosmos.

            Science is a collective enterprise...

            ...that embraces many cultures
            and spans the generations.

            In every age, and sometimes
            in the most unlikely places...

            ...there are those who wish
            with a great passion...

            ...to understand the world.

            We don't know where
            the next discovery will come from.

            What dream of the mind's eye
            will remake the world.

            These dreams begin
            as impossibilities.

            Once, even to see a planet through
            a telescope was an astonishment.

            But we studied these worlds...

            ...we figured out how
            they moved in their orbits...

            ...and soon we were planning
            voyages of discovery...

            ...beyond the Earth...

            ...and sending robot explorers
            to the planets and the stars.

            We humans long to be connected
            with our origins...

            ...so we create rituals.

            Science is another way
            to express this longing.

            It also connects us
            with our origins.

            And it, too, has its rituals
            and its commandments.

            Its only sacred truth is that
            there are no sacred truths.

            Temperature systems...

            SAGAN: All assumptions must
            be critically examined.

            Arguments from authority
            are worthless.

            FEMALE SCIENTIST:
            Transducer power is on.

            SAGAN: Whatever is inconsistent
            with the facts...

            ...no matter how
            fond of it we are...

            ...must be discarded or revised.

            Science is not perfect.

            It's often misused.

            It's only a tool.

            But it's the best tool we have...

            ...self-correcting, ever-changing...

            ...applicable to everything.

            With this tool,
            we vanquish the impossible.

            With the methods of science...

            ...we have begun
            to explore the cosmos.

            For the first time,
            scientific discoveries...

            ...are widely accessible.

            Our machines...

            ...the products of science...

            ...are now beyond
            the orbit of Saturn.

            A preliminary spacecraft
            reconnaissance...

            ...has been made of 20 new worlds.

            We have learned to value
            careful observations...

            ...to respect the facts, even
            when they are disquieting...

            ...when they seem to contradict
            conventional wisdom.

            The Canterbury monks faithfully
            recorded an impact on the moon...

            ...and the Anasazi people,
            an explosion of a distant star.

            They saw for us as we see for them.

            We see further than they only because
            we stand on their shoulders.

            We build on what they knew.

            We depend on free inquiry...

            ...and free access to knowledge.

            We humans have seen the atoms
            which constitute all of matter...

            ...and the forces that sculpt
            this world and others.

            We know
            the molecules of life...

            ...are easily formed
            under conditions common...

            ...throughout the cosmos.

            We have mapped the molecular machines
            at the heart of life.

            We have discovered a microcosm
            in a drop of water.

            We have peered
            into the bloodstream...

            ...and down on our stormy planet...

            ...to see the Earth
            as a single organism.

            We have found volcanoes
            on other worlds...

            ...and explosions on the sun...

            ...studied comets from
            the depths of space...

            ...and traced their origins
            and destinies...

            ...listened to pulsars...

            ...and searched for
            other civilizations.

            We humans have set foot
            on another world...

            ...in a place called
            the Sea of Tranquility...

            ...an astonishing achievement
            for creatures such as we...

            ...whose earliest footsteps,
            3 ? million years old...

            ...are preserved in the volcanic
            ash of East Africa.

            We have walked far.

            These are some of the things
            that hydrogen atoms do...

            ...given 15 billion years
            of cosmic evolution.

            It has the sound of epic myth.

            But it's simply a description...

            ...of the evolution of the cosmos...

            ...as revealed by science in our time.

            And we...

            ...we who embody the local
            eyes and ears...

            ...and thoughts and feelings
            of the cosmos...

            ...we've begun, at last, to wonder
            about our origins.

            Star stuff, contemplating the stars...

            ...organized collections of 10 billion-
            billion-billion atoms...

            ...contemplating the evolution
            of matter...

            ...tracing that long path by which
            it arrived at consciousness...

            ...here on the planet Earth...

            ...and perhaps, throughout the cosmos.

            Our loyalties are to the species
            and the planet.

            We speak for Earth.

            Our obligation to survive
            and flourish...

            ...is owed not just to ourselves...

            ...but also to that cosmos,
            ancient and vast...

            ...from which we spring.

            The greatest thrill for me
            in reliving this adventure...

            ...has been not just
            that we've completed...

            ...the preliminary reconnaissance
            with spacecraft...

            ...of the entire solar system.

            And not just that we've discovered...

            ...astonishing structures in
            the realm of the galaxies...

            ...but especially...

            ...that some of Cosmos' boldest
            dreams about this world...

            ...are coming closer to reality.

            Since this series' maiden voyage...

            ...the impossible has come to pass.

            Mighty walls that maintained
            insuperable ideological differences...

            ...have come tumbling down.

            Deadly enemies have embraced
            and begun to work together.

            The imperative to cherish
            the Earth...

            ...and to protect the global
            environment that sustains all of us...

            ...has become widely accepted.

            And we've begun, finally...

            ...the process of reducing...

            ...the obscene number of weapons
            of mass destruction.

            Perhaps we have, after all...

            ...decided to choose life.

            But we still have light-years
            to go to ensure that choice...

            ...even after the summits and
            the ceremonies and the treaties.

            There are still some 50,000
            nuclear weapons in the world.

            And it would require the detonation
            of only a tiny fraction of them...

            ...to produce a nuclear winter...

            ...the predicted global
            climatic catastrophe...

            ...that would result from the smoke
            and dust lifted into the atmosphere...

            ...by burning cities
            and petroleum facilities.

            The world's scientific community has
            begun to sound the alarm...

            ...about the grave dangers
            posed by...

            ...depleting the protective
            ozone shield...

            ...and by greenhouse warming.

            And again, we're taking some
            mitigating steps.

            But again,
            those steps are too small...

            ...and too slow.

            The discovery that such a thing as
            nuclear winter was really possible...

            ...evolved out of studies
            of Martian dust storms.

            The surface of Mars,
            fried by ultraviolet light...

            ...is also a reminder
            of why it's important...

            ...to keep our ozone layer intact.

            The runaway greenhouse effect
            on Venus...

            ...is a valuable reminder...

            ...that we must take the increasing
            greenhouse effect on Earth seriously.

            Important lessons about
            our environment...

            ...have come from spacecraft missions
            to the planets.

            By exploring other worlds...

            ...we safeguard this one.

            By itself, this fact
            more than justifies...

            ...the money our species has spent...

            ...in sending ships to other worlds.

            It is our fate...

            ...to live during one of
            the most perilous...

            ...and one of the most hopeful...

            ...chapters in human history.

            Our science and our technology...

            ...have posed us...

            ...a profound question:

            Will we learn to use these tools...

            ...with wisdom and foresight
            before it's too late?

            Will we see our species safely
            through this difficult passage...

            ...so that our children and
            grandchildren will continue...

            ...the great journey of discovery
            still deeper...

            ...into the mysteries of the cosmos?

            That same rocket and nuclear
            and computer technology...

            ...that sends our ships past
            the farthest known planet...

            ...can also be used to destroy
            our global civilization.

            Exactly the same technology...

            ...can be used for good...

            ...and for evil.

            It is as if...

            ...there were a god...

            ...who said to us:

            "I set before you two ways.

            You can use your technology
            to destroy yourselves...

            ...or to carry you to the planets
            and the stars.

            It's up to you."
