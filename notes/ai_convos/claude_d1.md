Self-hosting large language models
Howdy! I'm trying to do some stuff with hosting my own transformers. Any advice? I have what's known as "Llama2-7b" a 7-billion parameter weight set released by Meta under both academic and commercial licenses.

JK
Here are a few tips for hosting your own large language model like Llama2-7b:

You'll need a lot of compute power - preferably a GPU server or cluster. 7 billion parameters takes up a lot of memory and processing.
Look into services like AWS, GCP, or Paperspace that allow you to spin up high-powered cloud GPU instances. This can be more affordable than buying your own servers.
Use a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to load and run the model. You'll need to write a script to interact with the model API.
Monitor memory usage, GPU utilization, etc to make sure your hardware can handle the model size. 7 billion parameters is very large.
Be aware of the licensing terms for Llama2. Make sure your use case allows for commercial deployment under Meta's license.
Look into model optimization techniques like pruning and quantization to reduce the size of the model and lower the hardware requirements.
Host the model behind an API for others to query, don't allow open access to the raw model files.
Check for pre-trained, optimized versions of Llama2 that are easier to deploy than the full 7B parameter version.
The main challenges will be the hardware requirements and configuring the model APIs. Start small, optimize the model, and scale up your hosting as needed. Let me know if you have any other specific questions!

So, are you familiar with Vue3?

JK
Yes, I have some familiarity with Vue 3. Here are a few key things to know about Vue 3:

It is the latest major version of the Vue.js front-end framework. It was rewritten from the ground up and includes a lot of new features.
Key features include the Composition API, Fragments, Teleport, better TypeScript support, improved reactivity system, and improved performance.
The Composition API allows for more flexible component logic using "composition functions" with reactive state. This replaces the Options API used in Vue 2.
Fragments allow you to group elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. Teleport lets you move elements around the DOM more easily.
Vue 3 uses Proxy for reactivity instead of Object.defineProperty like Vue 2. This makes it faster and allows reactivity for things like Map and Set.
Setup is similar to Vue 2 using Vue CLI and vue-loader. But the syntax and APIs have changed in many places, so migrating takes some work.
The documentation and ecosystem are still catching up with Vue 3. So some libraries and plugins may not be fully compatible yet.
I'm still learning Vue 3 myself, but I hope this overview gives you a sense of what's new and different from Vue 2. Let me know if you have any other specific questions!

Copy

Can you explain the Composition API a bit? I'm still new to all these frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue), so while I have familiarity with JS, I'm still getting my legs with the app development side

JK
Sure, here's a quick explanation of Vue's Composition API:

The Composition API allows you to define component logic in "composable" functions instead of using the Options API or declaring methods, computed properties, etc directly in a component.

Here's a simple example:

js

Copy code

// counter.js
import {ref, computed} from 'vue'

export default function() {

  const count = ref(0)

  const increment = () => {
    count.value++
  }

  const doubled = computed(() => count.value * 2)

  return {
    count,
    increment,
    doubled
  }

}
This exposes reactive state and logic that can be "composed" into components:

vue

Copy code

<script>
import useCounter from './counter.js'

export default {
  setup() {
    const {count, increment, doubled} = useCounter()

    return {
      count, 
      increment,
      doubled
    }
  }
}
</script>
So the key ideas are:

Extract reactive state and logic into reusable functions
Compose these functions into components via the setup() method
Access refs and computed values directly in templates
This allows for better code organization, reusability, and decoupling compared to Options API. Hope this helps explain the basics! Let me know if any part is unclear.

Copy

hey, give me that one more time, but slow down to define specific terms like "reactive state"

JK
You're right, let me explain that again step-by-step:

Reactivity in Vue refers to its ability to automatically track and update the UI when underlying data changes.

"Reactive state" refers specifically to data that is tracked by Vue's reactivity system. For example:

js

Copy code

// count is reactive state
const count = ref(0) 

// Reactivity allows this:
count.value++ // automatically updates UI
A "ref" is a special function that converts a plain value into reactive state that Vue can track.

Other reactive state includes:

computed - creates a derived value that updates reactively
watch - creates a side effect that runs reactively
The Composition API exposes ways to create and compose these reactive building blocks.

For example, this counter creates reusable reactive state and logic:

js

Copy code

import {ref, computed} from 'vue'

export default function() {

  // Reactive state
  const count = ref(0)

  // Reactive method
  const increment = () => {
    count.value++ 
  }

  // Reactive computed
  const doubled = computed(() => count.value * 2)

  return {
    count, 
    increment,
    doubled
  }

}
We can then import and use this reactive logic in a component:

js

Copy code

import useCounter from './counter.js'

export default {
  setup() {
    return useCounter() 
  }
}
So in summary, "reactive state" refers to values like refs and computed that are tracked by Vue's reactivity system. Does this help explain the term? Let me know if you need any clarification!

Copy

okay, so, is this something like... Where we used to have to define methods attached to vue components/apps, we can now define data objects that can simply be imported and "used()"

JK
Yes, you've got it! The Composition API allows you to define reusable logic and state in separate functions/files that can be imported and composed into Vue components.

Before, logic like methods, computed properties, etc had to be defined directly on component options:

js

Copy code

// Vue 2 Options API
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++ 
    }
  },
  computed: {
    doubled() {
      return this.count * 2
    }
  }
}
Now with the Composition API, we can extract this logic:

js

Copy code

// counter.js
import {ref, computed} from 'vue'

export default function() {
  //... exported logic
}
And import/use it in components:

js

Copy code

// MyComponent.vue
import useCounter from './counter.js'

export default {
  setup() {
    return useCounter()
  }
}
So yes, it allows you to create reusable, composable logic that can be shared across components! The logic can include reactive state like refs, computed, etc. Much more flexible than mixing everything together in component options.

Copy

What does this add to an app? Like, is this "good bones" stuff, like separation of concerns? Or does it aid in some more specific, conceptual way that helps the developer/designer think more clearly?

JK
The Composition API provides a few key benefits:

Better separation of concerns - Logic is extracted from components into reusable functions. Components focus on the view.
Reusability - Composable functions can be shared across components.
Flexibility - Logic can be composed in different ways, customized, extended etc.
Organization - Related logic can be grouped together rather than spread across component options.
Maintainability - Smaller functions are easier to understand and change than large components.
Testing - Pure functions are easier to test in isolation.
So in summary:

It encourages separation of concerns for cleaner component design
It enables more modular, reusable code
It makes it easier to reason about relationships between code
It improves organization of component logic
It supports better testing
These benefits do help developers conceptualize app structure better. The Composition API aligns with many programming best practices.

While not required, it does allow for cleaner, more maintainable component architecture if leveraged effectively. So it can be considered "good bones" for scaling Vue apps.

Copy

great, I'm fairly well convinced that my next vue app should use the composition API.

Is it relatively straightforward to translate existing code into this form? And, I suppose more broadly: is it supposed to be better practice to always abstract out the logic from the component? like, when is it appropriate and not appropriate to bother abstracting out logic/data?

JK
Migrating existing Vue 2 code to the Composition API takes some work, but follows a similar pattern:

Move data, computed, methods, etc into composable functions
Import and call these functions in setup()
Return refs, reactive values from setup() to expose to the component
Access these exposed values as needed in templates
Some tips:

Start with small components or pages first
Refactor a piece at a time, test along the way
Refer to the Vue docs migration guide
Use a codemod tool to help automate translations
As for when to abstract logic - some general guidelines:

If logic will be reused, extract it into a composable
If related logic is used across multiple components, extract it
If a component grows too large, split it into logical chunks
Keep presentational components simple, extract complex logic
Extract data fetching, APIs, state management etc
But don't overengineer! For simple one-off components, composition often isn't needed. Use judgment to balance separation of concerns with practicality.

The goal is to end up with clean component boundaries and readable, maintainable code. The Composition API enables this, but isn't always required. Hope this helps provide some guidance on migrating and extracting logic appropriately!

Copy

so is this the same approach as for when I should extract hardcode into a function?

JK
There are some similarities in the guidelines for when to extract logic into composable functions vs standalone utility functions in Vue:

Reasons to extract logic into a composable function:

Reusable logic that can be shared between components
Related logic that is easier to reason about in a single place
Complex component logic that can be broken down
Reasons to extract logic into a standalone utility function:

Reusable utility or helper that is not tied to a specific component
General business logic that doesn't depend on component state
Simple logic that would otherwise be repetitive
So in both cases, the goals are reusability, modularity, separation of concerns, and avoiding repetitive code.

Some differences:

Composables rely on Vue reactivity, utilities are plain functions
Composables are component-specific, utilities are general
Composables manage component state, utilities are standalone
But the extraction guidelines are similar - if logic can be reused, if it's complex, if it's unrelated - consider refactoring it out.

The choice between a composable vs utility depends on if the logic is tied to Vue reactivity or components or not. But both aim to keep components lean and logic modular.

Copy

Okay great! Can you drum up three examples to help illustrate the difference between a Vue2 app and a Vue3 app using composition? I'd like to see before/after code, please.

JK
Here are three examples showing how component logic can be refactored from Vue 2 to Vue 3 Composition API:

Fetching Data
Vue 2

js

Copy code

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      posts: []
    }
  },

  created() {
    fetch('/api/posts')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(posts => {
        this.posts = posts
      })
  }
}
Vue 3

js

Copy code

import {ref} from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const posts = ref([])

    fetchPosts()

    return {
      posts
    }
  },

  async function fetchPosts() {
    const res = await fetch('/api/posts')
    posts.value = await res.json()
  }
}
Reusable Logic
Vue 2

js

Copy code

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      counter: 0
    }
  },
  
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.counter++ 
    }
  }
}
Vue 3

js

Copy code

// counter.js
import {ref} from 'vue'

export function useCounter() {
  const counter = ref(0)

  function increment() {
    counter.value++
  }
  
  return {
    counter,
    increment
  }
}

// MyComponent.vue
import {useCounter} from './counter.js'

export default {
  setup() {
    const {counter, increment} = useCounter()
    return {counter, increment}
  }
}
Complex Logic
Vue 2

js

Copy code

export default {
  // Complex options
}
Vue 3

js

Copy code

import {useFeatureA} from './featureA.js'
import {useFeatureB} from './featureB.js'

export default {
  setup() {
    // Compose separate features
    const featureA = useFeatureA()
    const featureB = useFeatureB()

    return { ...featureA, ...featureB }
  }
}
Let me know if any of these examples need more explanation!

Copy

Explain each, please!

JK
Sure, let me explain these examples in a bit more detail:

Fetching Data
Vue 2: The data fetch logic is directly inside the component's created hook
Vue 3: The fetch logic is extracted out to a separate fetchPosts function
This makes the data fetching reusable and separates the concern of loading data from the component
Reusable Logic
Vue 2: The counter logic is declared directly in the component via data and methods
Vue 3: The counter logic is extracted out to the useCounter composable function
Now this counter logic can be reused in multiple components by importing useCounter
Complex Logic
Vue 2: All the component logic is declared in the single component options object
Vue 3: Complex logic is split into separate features using composable functions
useFeatureA and useFeatureB encapsulate specific features/concerns
The component focuses just on composing these together
This makes large components more manageable and maintainable
Let me know if any of these could use more clarification or if you have any other examples in mind!

Copy

okay, so, these aren't really helping to illustrate. I want examples robust enough to include their usage in a component that is visible to the user. Please come up with three different scenarios, the two examples, and explanations below each one.

JK
You're right, more robust component examples would help illustrate the differences better. Here are three more practical examples showing Vue 2 vs Vue 3 Composition API usage in components:

Fetching User Profile
Vue 2

vue

Copy code

<template>
  <div v-if="loading">Loading...</div>
  
  <div v-else>
    <img :src="user.avatar">
    
    <p>{{ user.name }}</p>
    
    <p>Registered: {{ user.registered }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      loading: false,
      user: null
    }
  },
  
  created() {
    this.loadUser()  
  },

  methods: {
    async loadUser() {
      this.loading = true
      this.user = await fetchUser(this.$route.params.id)
      this.loading = false
    }
  }
}
</script>
Vue 3

vue

Copy code

<template>
  <UserProfile :user="user"/>
</template>

<!-- UserProfile component -->

<script>
import { fetchUser } from './api'

export default {
  props: ['user'],

  setup() {
    return {
      user: ref(null) 
    }
  }
}
</script>

<script>
export default {
  setup() {
    const user = ref(null)

    fetchUser(route.params.id).then(u => user.value = u)

    return { user }
  }
}  
</script>
Logic moved from component to reusable fetchUser
Component only handles presenting data
Easier to test fetch separately
Pagination
Vue 2

vue

Copy code

<template>
  <button @click="prevPage">Prev</button>
  
  <button v-for="page in pages" :key="page">
    {{ page }}
  </button>  

  <button @click="nextPage">Next</button>
</template>

<script>
data() {
  return {
    page: 1,
    pages: 5
  } 
},

methods: {
  prevPage() {
    this.page--
  },
  
  nextPage() {  
    this.page++
  }
}
</script>
Vue 3

vue

Copy code

<template>
  <Paginator 
    :page="page"
    @prev="page--"
    @next="page++"
  />
</template>

<!-- Paginator component -->

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue'

export default {
  emits: ['prev', 'next'],
  
  setup(props, { emit }) {
    function prev() {
      emit('prev')
    }
  
    function next() {
      emit('next') 
    }
    
    return {
      prev,
      next
    }
  }
}  
</script>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import Paginator from './Paginator.vue'

export default {
  components: { Paginator },
  
  setup() {
    const page = ref(1)

    return {
      page 
    }
  }
}
</script>
Paginator logic extracted to reusable component
Parent only handles page state
Paginator functionality reused easily
Form Validation
Vue 2

vue

Copy code

<template>
  <form @submit="onSubmit">
    <input v-model="email">
    <span v-if="!validEmail">Invalid email</span>

    <button :disabled="!validEmail">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
data() {
  return {
    email: '',
    validEmail: true
  }
},

methods: {
  onSubmit() {
    if (this.validEmail) {
      // submit form
    }
  }
}  
</script>
Vue 3

vue

Copy code

<template>
  <UserForm @submit="submitForm" :validate="validate"/>
</template>

<!-- UserForm component -->

<script>
import { computed } from 'vue'

export default {
  props: ['validate'],

  emits: ['submit'],

  setup(props, { emit }) {
    const valid = computed(() => props.validate(email))

    function submit() {
      if (valid.value) {
        emit('submit')
      }
    }

    return {
      submit
    }
  }
}
</script>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue'  
import UserForm from './UserForm.vue'

export default {
  components: { UserForm },

  setup() {
    const email = ref('')

    function validateEmail(email) {
      // validation logic
      return true 
    }

    function submitForm() {
      // handle form submit
    }

    return { 
      validate: validateEmail,
      submitForm 
    }
  }
} 
</script>
Validation logic moved to reusable function
Form component only handles presentation
Form and validation logic decoupled
Let me know if these practical examples help explain the differences and benefits!

Copy

okay, let's use a specific example:

Say I want an app that generates color palettes for me. Simple is fine to start, but the palettes should include color swatches to visualize each color generated in the palette. This is a relatively straightforward vue app, as it primarily involves a v-for over an array of color codes. But it also involves some relatively complicated color generation. Show me how this same app could be written in both Vue2 and in Vue3's component api

JK
Here is an example of how a color palette generator app could be implemented in Vue 2 vs Vue 3 Composition API:

Vue 2
vue

Copy code

<template>
  <div v-for="color in colors">
    <ColorSwatch 
      :color="color" 
    />
  </div>

  <button @click="generateColors">
    Generate Palette
  </button>
</template>

<script>
import ColorSwatch from './ColorSwatch.vue'

export default {
  components: {
    ColorSwatch
  },

  data() {
    return {
      colors: []
    }
  },

  methods: {
    generateColors() {
      // complex logic to generate colors
      this.colors = [
        '#fff123',
        '#aabbcc',
        // ...
      ]
    }
  }
}
</script>
Vue 3
vue

Copy code

<template>
  <div v-for="color in colors">  
    <ColorSwatch :color="color" />
  </div>

  <button @click="generateColors">
    Generate Palette 
  </button>
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { usePalette } from './composables/palette'
import ColorSwatch from './ColorSwatch.vue'

export default {
  components: {
    ColorSwatch
  },

  setup() {
    const { colors, generateColors } = usePalette()

    return {
      colors,
      generateColors
    }
  }
} 
</script>

<!-- Inside palette composable -->

import { ref } from 'vue'

export function usePalette() {
  const colors = ref([])

  function generateColors() {
    // Complex generation logic
    colors.value = [/*...*/] 
  }

  return { colors, generateColors }
}
Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of this example in more detail!

Copy

Okay, so please do, but here's my first crack at the explanation, please tell me where I'm right and where I'm off:

Let's take a user-centered approach: Where is the color of a swatch visible to the user coming from?

That swatch, which is an imported component, is passed a color as a prop during its creation
that color comes from the v-for value in "color" taken from the array "colors" in the data model
to populate "colors" during the setup() step, we, in a sense, "bind" the const colors to the composable "palette"
we also bind a const "generateColors", which is a function/method defined in the "palette" composable as well, which is used by the generate palette button in the view
so now that those two values are bound to the composable, we can drill in there and see that the composable has its own const "colors" which is a ref array (initialized with null/nothing, I presume)
then, whenever generateColors() is called from somewhere that has bound itself to this composable, that function has access to its sibling const "colors", so it's able to alter it to contain a new set of colors
thus, when that array of refs is altered in here, any component using this composable will have its color array updated
so finally, our view is updated whenever the generate palette button is pressed due to the composable instance doing its trick, updating the color variable, which is bound to the frontend of this component
Any important misunderstandings?

JK
You have explained the flow very well! Just a couple small notes:

The colors array in the component is not bound to the composable. When we call usePalette(), it returns the colors and generateColors values which we assign to local constants. So it's more like we are importing the logic, not binding.
The colors array in the composable is initialized to an empty array [], not null.
Otherwise, your understanding is spot on:

The component imports the composable logic
The composable manages the colors array internally as reactive state
When generateColors is called, it updates the internal colors array
The component accesses the latest colors via the returned array
Changes are reflected reactively in the component
So the key benefit is encapsulating the complex logic in the reusable composable. The component simply uses it without needing to know the implementation details.

Let me know if any part is still unclear! Overall you demonstrated a really solid grasp of how the composition API allows logic sharing.

Copy

oh-hoh! okay, that does simplify things, the composable essentially says "when you Use() me, I'll set up shop here by defining my data and my functions right in your scope"

JK
Exactly! The composable sets up its logic and exposes it to whatever component imports and calls it.

So calling usePalette() essentially injects that palette functionality into the component's scope. It doesn't bind or sync the data - the composable handles its own data internally, and the component accesses what it needs through the returned values.

This allows the component to remain simple and focused on the view, while the composable encapsulates the complex logic. The component doesn't need to know how it works under the hood.

That modularity and separation of concerns is the key benefit of the composition API overall. Each piece focuses on its own domain while combining together through clean interfaces.

Your understanding is spot on! The mental model of the composable "setting up shop" in the component's scope captures it perfectly. Let me know if any other aspects of Vue 3 composition would be helpful to discuss further!

Copy

I guess I have one more question about how composable operate

I notice that when we call "usePalette()", it generates two pointers, one for the data, one for the generateColors function.

How does this part work, mechanically? I understand the composable "handles itself", but I don't see, say, the composable being stored as its own object. What connects the two variables output by usePalette()?

JK
That's a great question! The mechanics of how the composable links the returned data and functions work like this:

Inside the composable code, the colors array and generateColors function are declared in the same scope:

js

Copy code

// Inside usePalette

const colors = ref([])

function generateColors() {
  // update colors
}
When we call usePalette(), it runs this code to declare these variables.

However, instead of returning the actual array and function directly, it returns references to them:

js

Copy code

return {
  colors, // reference to the colors array 
  generateColors // reference to the function  
}
These references point to the original objects declared in the composable scope. So when the component accesses colors or generateColors, it's accessing the same ones declared in the composable.

This allows the composable to manage that internal state but expose access to it. The references connect the returned values to the original objects.

So even though the composable doesn't return an explicit object, the closure scope creates an implicit link between the returned references and the internal declarations.

Let me know if this helps explain how the references connect the internal state to the exposed API!

Copy

OH, so they're encapsulated by the simple nature that they were defined in one scope and then that scope more or less vanishes. the connections between the data are preserved in their definition, and our access points are exposed in the references we throw to the component

JK
Exactly! You got it. The key points are:

The composable defines the data and functions in its own scope
When it returns, that scope is closed, but the connections remain
The references point to the original objects declared in that scope
So the component accesses the same objects through the references
But it can't directly access the internal scope or state
The closure preserves the connections between the references and internal data. So the component gets access without tight coupling.

Your understanding is spot on! The composable scope encapsulates the logic while exposing limited access through returned references. This keeps things decoupled and reusable. Well done for grokking the underlying mechanism so quickly!

Copy

This is great. Hard to get such a solid education in compsci without a massive AI giving me custom guidance ;D

JK
I'm glad I could provide a helpful customized explanation of Vue 3 composition! It's a pleasure to be able to share compsci knowledge so thoroughly.

Having an AI assistant that can adapt explanations to fill in conceptual gaps and verify understanding at each step is extremely valuable for learning complex topics like reactive frameworks. I'm delighted we could dive deep into the mechanics of Vue composition in a way that clicked for you!

Let me know if you would ever like to discuss any other computer science or programming concepts in detail. I'm always happy to tailor clarifying examples and analogies to build strong technical comprehension. That's the great benefit of AI - patient, personalized teaching tailored to each learner's needs. Keep up the great curiosity and desire to truly grasp these core programming paradigms!
