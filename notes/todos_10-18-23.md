priority:
- need to pass the ID along with the calls now
- need to do something with the logged timestamps, userIDs, context_paths, etc. 
- backend textfile dump endpoint (partially developed)
- needs to deploy

- copy-paste button at top

- make sure send-chat-to-server function encrypts the data using the existing key


look into:
  - electron (portable mode)


usability:
- contrast on colors is low, also might want outline
- hover text on buttons, restore button-ness
- new semiotics for send message
- make top buttons more flexible for skinnier phones
- also check up on min-height for the main app body. 

- turn "system prompts" and "configs" into "ai cartridges"

- visualize system prompts

artsy:
- random colors on each conversation
- random colors on each token
- tiktoken counts while you type

bugs:
- typing on mobile when cursor isn't at end fails to do what we wanted. (should make it add an enter at the cursor's position, not the end)


new data model:

conversation as main unit--
  - but contains all metadata for the calls as well
  - essentially want the full conversation state

also want an app-state--
  - mutedness, 

messages also want this data--
  - each message could come from a different model / source, 
  - or have other settings changed like temperature.
