user needs:
- copy-paste button at top
  x or "save as file"
- needs to deploy

usability:
x mute button

security:
x basic "doesn't work unless you use an approved number" security
x sanitize the temperature input

info:
- need to pass the ID along with the calls now
- need to do something with the logged timestamps, userIDs, context_paths, etc. 

look into:
  - electron (portable mode)


- turn "system prompts" and "configs" into "ai cartridges"

- visualize system prompts

artsy:
- random colors on each conversation
- random colors on each token
- tiktoken counts while you type

bugs:
- typing on mobile when cursor isn't at end fails to do what we wanted. (should make it add an enter at the cursor's position, not the end)
