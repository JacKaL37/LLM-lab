user needs:
- copy-paste button at top
  - or "save as file"
- needs to deploy

security:
- basic "doesn't work unless you use an approved number" security

info:
- need to do something with the logged timestamps, userIDs, context_paths, etc. 

electron (portable mode)
- turn "system prompts" and "configs" into "ai cartridges"

artsy:
- random colors on each conversation
- random colors on each token
- tiktoken counts while you type

bugs:
- typing on mobile when cursor isn't at end fails to do what we wanted. (should make it add an enter at the cursor's position, not the end)
