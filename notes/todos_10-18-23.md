user needs:
- copy-paste button at top
- needs to deploy


info:
- need to pass the ID along with the calls now
- need to do something with the logged timestamps, userIDs, context_paths, etc. 

look into:
  - electron (portable mode)

usability:
- contrast on colors is low, also might want outline
- hover text on buttons, restore button-ness
- new semiotics for send message

- turn "system prompts" and "configs" into "ai cartridges"

- visualize system prompts

artsy:
- random colors on each conversation
- random colors on each token
- tiktoken counts while you type

bugs:
- typing on mobile when cursor isn't at end fails to do what we wanted. (should make it add an enter at the cursor's position, not the end)
