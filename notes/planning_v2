Switch to a pre-canned chat interface. This may come with drawbacks, but we need to enter from that end first. 

Primary goals:
- get all modalities available from openAI integrated
  - text2text - gpt4
  - img(+text)2text - gpt4 vision preview
  - speech2text - whisper
  - text2speech - openAI's tts
  - text2img - Dall-E 3
- get the usability up to everyday-use standards
  - navigating conversations by name, date, and even visualizing them in semantic space
  - accounts and proper server-side security
  - save and load conversation transcripts
  - custom prompting right in the app
  - token counts (and cost estimations from model)
