basics- https://cogmate.app/

- ID entry: your student ID (got all of you, but let me know if not)

- prompt selection: 366:onramp, 366:explore

- sending messages
  - responses stream in

- upper right navigate conversations

--- all stored locally! can reload. 
  - saves state after each AI message completes
  - uses "localStorage", so your stuff is persistent
    - but, it's specific to WHERE you're using it-- browser, browser session, phone, etc

- dropdown panel
  - volume!
  - temperature: 0-1, resets/defaults 0.7 (creativity vs consistency)
  - save button (this is how you'll turn a conversation in)
  - explode button: deletes all your conversations and states to start from scratch. (also helps with certain bugs, but I've squashed most of those)
  - X button: deletes the current conversation


text features:
- uses GPT-4 (until yesterday dropped gpt-4-turbo, this is the most powerful!)
  - this is a unique opportunity for most, as this is NOT the free version. if you haven't tried it, now's the time. 
- the different prompt options are for different course tasks
- it's great with markdown and code writing. 


gpt-4 features:
- compared to 3.5, it's much more powerful at deconstructing complex tasks, explanations, and overall anything that involves the more complex combination of ideas
  - HOW does it do this? -- it's big, like, 10-100x bigger than gpt3.5. hidden layers provide room for more abstractions. 
- it's better at understanding what you mean, not just the literal things you say. 
  - HOW does it do this? -- embeddings. all your words are converted into large vectors of numbers that exist in a semantic space relative to others, and that is what gets encoded by the model, not your literal text strings. 

general features:
- it's an infinitely patient tutor
- it's a domain expert (but you should still ALWAYS know enough about what you're doing to be able to check it)
- it's a motivated collaborator
- it listens. I know that's silly, it's the ELIZA effect, eh? 


other cool app bits-- 
- technically functions as a standalone web app
  - on your phone, you can hit the "share" button in your default browser and then something like "add to home screen" (ios), or similar on android
  - on desktop, your browser will have a little "download" button in the URL bar at the right, near the bookmark star in Chrome
  - what it does is turn it into a little lightweight app that functions on its own


You're welcome to use it as you like for the duration of the course!
- only mild caution is, y'know, if you're using it all day every day, we might need to talk about you getting your own account, I'm not made of cash, haha
- but that would be extreme, if you just wanna sit down with it on occasion and have an in-depth session, or pepper it with exploratory questions throughout the day, all that's great and I encourage it!
