"rad, let's dive into some of those musical scales!\n\n1.
 
 Blues Scale: This one's a bit funky. It's kind of like a minor pentatonic scale, but with an added lowered 5th. The ratios might look like `[1, 6/5, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5]`\n\n2. 
Minor Pentatonic: The minor pentatonic offers a totally different vibe than the major. Its note ratios are `[1, 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5]`.\n\n3. 
Major Scale: The good old diatonic major scale, it's the `do-re-mi` we all grew up with. The ratios for this scale would be `[1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8]`.\n\n4. 
Minor Scale: The natural minor scale offers a more melancholic sound, the ratios here are `[1, 9/8, 6/5, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 9/5]`.\n\n5. 
Whole Tone: This scale divides the octave into 6 equal parts, giving it a dreamy, surreal sound. Your ratios will be `[1, 9/8, 5/4, 45/32, 3/2, 8/5]`.\n\nNow remember, these ratios are based on the 'equal temperament' system used in Western music where the octave is divided into 12 equal parts.\n\nAlso, your oscillator might not work well with some of these frequency ratios. In case you're experiencing buzzing or wrong notes, you need to bring your frequencies within your oscillator's range.\n\nHope that jazzes up your coding session! Keep the tunes flowing, mate!
