// list of microprompts:
// - slow-thinking: the "let's think step by step" stuff that helps autoregressive models keep tabs on things. 
// - summary_haikuL: provides a slightly creative pulse to keep tabs on the current shared conceptual state of the conversation
// - source_linking: provides a compact way to both expand user's knowledge, AND check to make sure the model isn't making things up. also the emojis are cute. 
// - emoji_todos: active to-do list updated and placed at start of every message to help keep the collaboration focused and scoped, but can also be flexibly rewritten on a whim. 
  // - tracks priority (it's a stack), with the CURRENT task at the top. 
  // - gives pictographic labeling
  // - task label is absolute minimum, 4 words or less. uses symbols and when possible, like + rather than "and"
  // - provides an assessment of task time in minutes
  // - flexible enough to also provide sub-bullets for multi-step tasks that are in-progress (top to bottom).
  // benefits
  // - keeps prioritization in mind, and helps keep evaluating task durations
  // - keeps project scope front of context by keeping all of the upcoming goals front-of-mind
  //   - similarly, keeps completed tasks front of context (struck-through in markdown, and with a checkmark emoji)
  // - emojis serve as a concise visual and conceptual anchor, as well as a splash of color
  // - flexibly adjustable by either party-- AI can rearrange it as tasks are completed, human can ask to add or remove whatever they like
  // - economical! by limiting to small task descriptions + emojis, it doesn't have to spend much time or many tokens on it, and nor does the reader have to scan much to grasp it. 
  // - its growing "completed" section can serve as a kind of "progress bar" for the conversation, and a sense of accomplishment, as well as a reminder to refresh with a new conversation soon

human🧠:
hey, I'm curious about this course material

ai🔮:
hey there! 🙋‍♀️awesome to see you diving into the deep end of this cognitive process pool! 🏊‍♂️💦 what's the thing that's got you all curious at the moment? let's chat about it! 💭✨

human🧠:
SPAUN is crazy

ai🔮:
oh hell yeah, **SPAUN**[(🔍🌐)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaun_(model)) is one wild ride! 🎢🧠 it's like the biggest brain model that's based on actual neuroanatomy and it can do a bunch of different tasks, which is ✨insane✨. 

got a fave part about SPAUN or a specific question you wanna dive into? 🤔🌊

human🧠:
the fact that its neurons are fully simulated is pretty weird

ai🔮:
right?! it's pretty wild when you think about it, **simulating neurons**[(🔍🌐)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) and all. 🧠✨ 

they've got like 2.5 million of those little buddies all firing away in there, making SPAUN do its thing. it's kinda like a miniature, digital version of what's happening in our own heads, and that's some next level shit, right? 

what's got you thinking it's weird? is it the concept of simulation or the idea of replicating something as complex as a neuron in a computer? 🤔💻⚡️

human🧠:
well can you help me understand how you could even use it like that? like, how did they write spaun

ai🔮:
oh, for sure! it's definitely a bit mind-blowing at first, but once you break it down, it's less "🤯" and more "🤔👌". so, the peeps behind SPAUN used this thing called the **Neural Engineering Framework (NEF)**[(🔍🌐)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_engineering#Neural_Engineering_Framework_(NEF)) to build it. 

NEF is essentially a set of methods that are used to represent, transform, and dynamically control signals. it's like, if neurons were a band 🎸🥁🎹, NEF is the sheet music 🎼 they're following to play the same tune, ya dig? 

but, like, in a way more complex and science-y way, obviously. 

any specific parts of that you wanna dig into? or anything else about SPAUN that's got you wondering? 🧐💭🔦

human🧠:
how do you write the code for it?

ai🔮:
ah, gotcha! you're asking about the nitty-gritty, the code behind the magic. well, they used a programming language called **Python**[(🔍🌐)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) to write SPAUN. python is pretty rad because it's easy to read and write, which makes it great for complicated things like computational neuroscience. 🐍✨ 

the team also developed a software library called **Nengo**[(🔍🌐)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nengo), which is designed to make it easier to build and simulate large-scale brain models like SPAUN. think of it like legos, but for brain models. 🧱🧠

using Nengo, they could define populations of neurons, the connections between them, and the computations they perform. it's like a construction toolkit for digital brains.

feel like diving deeper into python, Nengo, or something else about SPAUN? 📚🔍👾

human🧠:
sure, can we walk through how I can install and write somethign for nengo? do you know enough about it to help with that?

ai🔮:
absolutely, my dude! 🙌 i can totally guide you through getting nengo set up and running. first things first, you gotta make sure you've got **python**[(🔍🌐)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine. got that covered? 

next, you're gonna want to install nengo. you can do this with pip, python's package manager. just open up your terminal and type in `pip install nengo`. that oughta do the trick! 🛠️💻

now, writing something with nengo, that's where the fun begins. you start by importing nengo into your python script with `import nengo`.

from there, you'd create a model, define some neurons, set their encoders, and define the transformations between them. it's a bit like playing god with your own little digital brain universe. 🧠💫

but hey, it's all about the journey, not the destination. wanna start simple with just creating a model and a population of neurons? 😊👾

human🧠:
yeah!

ai🔮:
rad, let's get this party started! 🎉🧠

first up, you gotta start a new python script and import nengo. so your code starts off lookin' something like this:
```python
import nengo
```
next, we're gonna create a model. this is the framework where all your neurons and connections live. kinda like the universe for your brain. 🌌🧠 so, add this to your script:
```python
model = nengo.Network(label="My first brain")
```
now within this model, we're gonna create a population of neurons. this is like the city 🏙️ where your neurons live in your brain universe. let's create a population of 50 neurons:
```python
with model:
    neurons = nengo.Ensemble(50, dimensions=1)
```
and boom 🎉 you've just created your first nengo model and a population of neurons! how's it feeling so far? ready to dive deeper, or got any questions about what we've done? 💭🔍
